    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I'm a software developer that works in a variety of languages including, but not limited to; C#, ColdFusion, Java, and Ruby. I mainly blog about small problems I solve and when I think the solution will be useful to other people.
I am OS agnostic and I use Windows, Mac OS, and Linux in order of frequency. I'm a father and husband and I love to play sports. If you're interested in my personal life as opposed to the professional, I have <a href="http://rawlinson.us/">a different blog</a> for that.</p>
