So, color me ignorant, but one thing I've always disliked about windows calculator is when you have a large number, say 3 trillion, there are no commas to help you group the digits and easily identify the value for what it is.<br /><br />Well, you can have it display commas.  Go to the "View" menu and select "Digit Grouping" and BAM! you have commas.<br /><br />Simple and easy.  I don't know for how many years that has existed but I just found out about it today.  I don't think I've ever looked at any of the menu's on the calculator so now I'll have to explore a bit more.</div>

Thanks Bill! Had the same problem over the many years. Got tired of it and was trying to find online calculators &#39;with commas&#39; to no avail. Stumbled on your post. Heck, the Windows calculator even has scientific format - who knew!</div>

Who knew! I have Dyslexia so this is a tremendous help. Thanks for sharing the info... and I&#39;ve used that calculator 100,000 times - oops, that was 1,000,000 times and never even bothered to browse that menu.</div>

Wow, I feel stupid for not having found this myself years ago (If it existed that long ago).<br /><br />Given that I have double-vision, the lack of commas in Windows&#39; calculator was extremely difficult to use.  I do frequent calculations involving high value formulas and large number sets and I often found myself holding my finger up to the screen and counting off each third number and mentally assigning commas.<br /><br />I was even considering buying third party calculator software to compensate for this problem, so this tip has not only saved me an untold amount of time, but has also saved me money.<br /><br />Thank you so much!</div>

Jebus, thank you. Why I didn&#39;t figure that out myself I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a million options there. But thanks nonetheless!</div>
