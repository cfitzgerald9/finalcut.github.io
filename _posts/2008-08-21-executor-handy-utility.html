Yesterday I was browsing around when I came across the nifty app launching utility called <a href="http://executor.dk/">Executor</a>.  Executor is sort of like "<a href="http://www.launchy.net">Launchy</a>" but has a few differences.  First off it doesn't support plugins like Launchy.  It also doesn't have as much of a fan base.  However, I like it better.  It has a bunch of nice features and does everything I want it to do.<br /><br />There are a bunch of "<a href="http://home25.inet.tele.dk/mb/executor/didyouknow.html">secret</a>" commands and <a href="http://home25.inet.tele.dk/mb/executor/hidden.html">options</a> in it as well.   You might be wondering why I like it better than Launchy? Sadly, that isn't easy to answer.  Executor just behaves the way I want.  It seems to offer me more default options and is pretty darn customizable.  It supports hotkeys (which I pretty much love having) for quick application launching.  It is more keyword based than Launchy and overall just seems a bit more powerful in it's base configuration.<br /><br />I don't really need GCal or Twitter or any other web based social media integration with my app launcher - I just want an easy to use and powerful command line tool and Executor fits the bill nicely.</div>
