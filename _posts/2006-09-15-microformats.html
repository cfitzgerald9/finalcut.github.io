I have to admit I've been a bit slow on the uptake with microformats.  However, the more I have read about them the more sense they make to me.  However, due to the lack of readilly available tools that make use of microformats they may still take a while before they get more widespread adoption. If you are like me and need more info on microformats check out "<a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/the_big_picture_on_microformats/">The Big Picture on Microformats</a>.<br /><br />I currently use two different tools that deal specifically with microformats.  The first, <a href="http://structuredblogging.org">Structured Blogging</a> (site was down when I wrote this), is a wordpress plugin that makes it easy to create content in microformats.  The second, <a href="http://blog.codeeg.com/tails-firefox-extension-03/">Tails 0.3.4</a>, is a firefix extension that makes it easy for me to extract microformat information from webpages.<br /><br />I tried a couple of earlier version of Tails (and flocktails and tails export) but there was one bug in them that was a showstopper.  Basically it messed up the tab cycling feature in firefox so that if you hit ctrl+tab it would cycle two tabs instead of just one.  Fortunately, that is fixed in 0.3.4 and it is pretty capable of handling a variety of different microformats.<br /><br />I think the two microformats that I might have the most use for, currently, as a consumer are <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">hCalendar</a> and <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a>.<br /><br />Here are a couple links that deal specificially with microformats or how to use them:<br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/highlight-microformats-with-css">Highlight Microformats with CSS</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN</a> - A relationship microformat</li><br /><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformats">Wikiepedia microformat article</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://microformats.org/">Official microformats home</a></li><br /></ul></div>
