Well, I tried Flock again. I gave it a full week of dedicated usage and while I see a lot of potential it still isn't ready for me as my primary browser.  Perhaps once Firefox 3 comes out and then Flock is based on it Flock will be able to live on my system - but until then it just can't hang.  Why? Well, mostly because it slows my system down and that is unacceptable.<br /><br /><em><strong><br />I have to <a href="http://cf-bill.blogspot.com/2008/04/dpc-deferred-procedure-calls.html">retract this entire statement</a>. I was wrong and, Flock, I'm sorry I disparaged you so!  Please forgive me.</strong></em><br /><br /><br /><br />I have a lot of different accounts around the web; flicker, youtube, facebook, twitter, another youtube, gmailx4 and I think it is this abundance of accounts that is causing the problems.  Basically, if I leave Flock running for a while my system processes become consumed by DPCs (Deferred Procedure Calls).  Once it begins my computer becomes nearly unresponsive as the DPC's use a consistent 50% or more of the CPU.  <br /><br />I realize I don't need all those social accounts -heck I don't really use most of them - but I want to try to find the value in them.  I still don't reall grok twitter (it seems like a waste of time) or facebook (which seems like a jumbled mess of information) but I figured I should give 'em a go.  <br /><br />So, for the time being I'm back to Firefox.  The only social site I really want/need is Google Reader and there is a handy plugin for that - plus Gmail and I use the Gmail manager plugin for that.  In fact, I think I'm going to go download the latest public Beta and give it a whirl.  If the reports are true I might be willing to put up with it's bugs for it's performance enhancements.</div>
