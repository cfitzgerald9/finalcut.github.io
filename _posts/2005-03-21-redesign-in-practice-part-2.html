<div class='post'>
In my last post I talked about ProTask (an issue management system) and, sort of, covered how it was designed during its first two iterations. In this and any subsequent posts on the topic I will discuss the design as it stands currently, why I have made some of the decisions I have made, and where I am still stuck as far as design decisions go (and why I'm stuck).<br /><br />In my last iteration there were seven CFCs in the entire application and they each contained way more logic than they should of - there was no real separation between the business layer and the data storage mechanism or from the KD framework for that matter. If an action seemed like it was primarilly associated with one or more instances of one of my seven objects that is where method went. It wasn't the best process for vetting out my system methods - but I didn't know what else to do.<br /><br />Now, however, things are cleaning up quite a bit. There is still some confusion on my part - but overall things are looking much better. Today I am just going to discuss a couple broad topics then I will narrow my focus in subsequent posts. As a convetion my objects will be in ALL CAPS.<br /><br />My first decision was that I do not want any front end to have to know too much about all of these different objects. In fact, if I can help it I want to have one simple facade to the whole underlying system. I believe this will work (almost) considering the current scope of the application. Basically, when someone interacts with the system they are dealing with one PROJECT at a time. A PROJECT consists of zero or more ISSUEs, zero or more AREAs, zero or more BILLING codes, ten PRIORITY(ies), and zero or more MILESTONEs. Since you can not create any of the sub items without having a PROJECT first I don't expose any of their methods publicly - just on a package level. To facilitate this I have a big <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/SessionFacade.html">facade</a> object titled project.cfc. I will probably end up renaming this as it ended up conflicting with my <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BeanPattern">bean</a> object naming.<br /><br />Initially I had planned on calling my beans something like projectbean.cfc and issuebean.cfc but that quickly grew tedious so I went back and renamed all of them to just issue.cfc, area.cfc etc.. except projectbean.cfc which I haven't renamed yet due to my project facade object. I suppose I could name the project facade projectfacade.cfc but that seems pretty clunky to me. I will come up with something better.<br /><br />I mentioned that this project facade would almost work for hiding all of the complexity of the system design from the user while still exposing all of the functionality he/she might need. The problem arises when you are trying to get a view into many PROJECTs to see some simple statistics on the ISSUEs in that project. For instance with our KD portal we have a view that shows how many ISSUEs are bugs, questions, features, or tasks in PROJECTs that the current person is a USER in. My project facade deals with a single PROJECT (it takes an optional projectID as part of it's initialization).<br /><br />Therefore there is also a projects.cfc which is a facade as well. It gives you some access to very limited information about mutliple projects and can also return to you an instance of my project facade class. So, right now to use the system you have to initialize one object:<br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br /> myProjects = createobject("component","com.sbcs.protask.projects").init(request.site.datasource,request.site.databaseType);<br /></pre><br /><em>request.site is a structure currently defined by our KD framework that holds a variety of configuration information including the database type and the dsn name (datasource).</em><br /><br />If you want a specific project facade you just call<br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br /> thisProject = myProjects.get(attributes.projectID);<br /></pre><br /><br />Those two initializtion paramters of datasource and databasetype are used within the system to determine what <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/CompositeEntity.html">composite objects</a> and what <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/DataAccessObject.html">DAO objects</a> to use - I'll get into those areas in a later post.<br /><br />the project facade object really does very little beyond managing the calls to the appropriate decendant objects for processing. However, I do have one method that is floating in there currently that I can't figure out where it goes: determineIssueStatus. It takes in the following parameters and based on this information determines what the status of the ISSUE should be:<br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br /> &lt;cffunction name="determineIssueStatus" access="private" output="false" returntype="com.sbcs.protask.issue.issue" hint="determines the status for an issue"&gt;<br /><br />  &lt;cfargument name="issue" type="com.sbcs.protask.issue.issue" required="true"  hint="the issue to evaluate" /&gt;<br /><br />  &lt;cfargument name="user"  type="com.sbcs.protask.user.user" required="false" default="#arguments.issue.getAddedBy()#" hint="the user performing the current action" /&gt;<br />  &lt;cfargument name="approved" type="numeric" required="false" hint="" default="0"&gt;<br />  &lt;cfargument name="accepted" type="numeric" required="false" hint="" default="0"&gt;<br />  &lt;cfargument name="open"  type="numeric" required="false" hint="" default="0"&gt;<br />  &lt;cfargument name="locked" type="numeric" required="false" hint="" default="0"&gt; <br />  &lt;cfargument name="resolved" type="numeric" required="false" hint="" default="0"&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />I don't think it belongs in a gateway (to be honest, I may have gateway and composite object naming mixed up or at least the functionality mucked together into one composite gateway object) as they deal with multiple records and I'm only working on one issue. I don't think it goes in a DAO because it doesn't touch the data layer at all. I know it doesn't really fit in the project facade - but until I can come up with a better place for it that is where it will sit. About the only place I can think of that might, and this is a big might, be better for it currently is in the issue bean. However, I don't think the bean should really be determining anything - it just holds data (and perhaps validates it) but it shouldn't be computing anything that I know of.<br /><br />Another area that I keep bouncing around on currently is the file structure of my CFC collection. As you can see from the arguments I have shown I store them under the com/sbcs/protask directory. However, I currently plop each in a directory that applies to the object as well - so there is some redundancy in the calling of the bean objects such as com.sbcs.protask.user.user. I may change that so that they are all in the same root directory later. Currently the only cfc's in my root com.sbcs.protask directory are projects.cfc, project.cfc, daofactory.cfc, and gatewayfactory.cfc. You'll notice I did add the pattern name to the factory objects and that is because that makes sense to me. I also add DAO to plain dao objects. However, plain gateways dont have the word gateway in their name. For instance one gateway is projectissues.cfc which deals with many ISSUEs within a PROJECT.<br /><br />One drawback to my current setup - and I really don't view it as much of a drawback - is that I have a very large number of methods in my project.cfc (the facade object). Alot of these methods map directly to a method in one of the dependant classes so that my project.cfc method just consists of lines like:<br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br /> &lt;cffunction name="getUserIssues" access="public" output="false" returntype="query"&gt;<br />  &lt;cfargument name="userID" type="string" required="true" /&gt;<br /><br />  &lt;cfreturn variables.instance.issues.getAssignedTo(arguments.userID) /&gt;<br /> &lt;/cffunction&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />The reason I don't consider this a real drawback is because the API for anyone else is very simple. They only have to know about the methods exposed via projects.cfc and project.cfc. They never have to worry about instantiating any other object as project.cfc will generate new, empty single instance objects for everything they might need to directly interface. The only objects beyond projects and project that expose their internal methods are the bean objects which expose all of their getters and setters.<br /><br />The exposed getters and setters will probably be modified in the future to support the use of a <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/TransferObject.html">transfer object</a> where applicable as it seems there will be less overhead in using them, especially when dealing with the display of an objects data (calling multiple getters on an object).</div>
