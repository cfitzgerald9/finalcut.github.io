As hard as it might be to believe I do a lot of other things beyond writing and hacking at code.  I play a ton of sports but, to stay true to my geek stereotype I also read a lot.  I mostly read speculative fiction (fantasy, not much sci-fi), military fiction, and a bunch of non-fiction and now I've started <a href="http://billthebookcritic.blogspot.com/">my own blog to talk about those books</a>.<br /><br />Recently I also started reading a bunch of review blogs and, truth be told, I think the idea is pretty cool.  I've written a few book reviews on my personal blog before but I had never really thought of devoting a blog to just the books I read.  Now, however, I have decided to give it a go.  I've not had much experience writing reviews while not spoiling the books so at the moment my reviews are definitely far more about my impression of the book as opposed to what takes place in it.  Hopefully that format will be interesting to some readers.<br /><br />If you happen to visit <a href="http://billthebookcritic.blogspot.com/">my new review blog</a> please drop a comment and let me know if the review is useful or not.  Either way any suggestions or advice on what might make the reviews better would be great.<br /><br />Here are some of the other sites I've been visiting/reading:<br /><a href="http://aidanmoher.com/blog">A Dribble of Ink</a><br /><a href="http://www.graemesfantasybookreview.com">Graeme's Fantasy Book Review</a><br /><a href="http://fantasyhotlist.blogspot.com/">Pat's Fantasy Hotlist</a><br /><a href="http://thewertzone.blogspot.com/">The Wertzone</a><br /><br />And now, back to your regularly scheduled programming of programming trivia..</div>
