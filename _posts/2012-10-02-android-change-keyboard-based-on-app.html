Today I discovered that my password manager, LastPass, comes with it's own keyboard to make it easier to fill out forms with your username and password. &nbsp;The thing is, the majority of the time, I still want to use Swype but I'm too lazy to toggle my keyboards. &nbsp;In fact, there is only one app where I always want the LastPass keyboard and that's my banking app. &nbsp;The banking app won't let me past into the login fields but the LastPass keyboard can auto fill the forms for me.<br /><br />Well, fortunately, Tasker has come to the rescue yet again. &nbsp;Note, however, that you need a rooted device to do this stuff. &nbsp;I am not going to take the time right now to explain how to root your device sorry. &nbsp;Instead I'll assume you've rooted and you own <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;feature=related_apps#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEwOSwibmV0LmRpbmdsaXNjaC5hbmRyb2lkLnRhc2tlcm0iXQ..">Tasker</a>.<br /><br />After installing Tasker you will also need a plugin called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5pbnRhbmdpYmxlb2JqZWN0LnNlY3VyZXNldHRpbmdzLnBsdWdpbiJd">Secure Settings</a>. &nbsp;You can get it at the play store. &nbsp;Ok, before you jump into tasker first start up Secure Settings, switch to the Helper Tab, and install the helper. &nbsp;You can't do anything without the Helper; it is what gives you access to the command to change the keyboard.<br /><br />Ok, now that your prerequisites are setup launch Tasker and do the following:<br /><br /><br /><ol><li>Create a new profile; I called mine "LastPass"</li><li>Select the "Application" context</li><li>Pick the app you want to use the special keyboard in. &nbsp;I picked my banking app.</li><li>Select "New Task" &nbsp;I called mine "Start LastPass"</li><li>Add an action; select "Plugin"</li><li>Pick "Secure Settings"</li><li>Edit the configuration by selecting the "Edit" button</li><li>Scroll down a bit and find the "Helper Actions" section</li><li>Pick the "Input Method" Helper Action.</li><li>Select your special case keyboard; I picked "LastPass"</li><li>Click the save icon which looks like an old school 3.5" disk in the bottom left corner.</li><li>Leave the "IF" checkbox empty</li><li>Click on the green checkmark or confirmation button</li><li>Click on the green checkmark or confirmation button again.</li><li>At this point you have a profile that has a Start Task that will start your keyboard; now you need to setup an Exit task to switch back to your normal keyboard.</li><li>Long press on the start task (Start LastPass) and a menu will appear.</li><li>Choose "Add Exit Task"</li><li>Follow steps 4-14 but this time call your task "Start <favorite keyboard="keyboard">" where favorite keyboard is your favorite. &nbsp;I called mine "Start Swype"</favorite></li><li>Once you finish with step 14 again you'll see you have a start and exit task setup. &nbsp;Close tasker.</li><li>Go to your special app and launch it; see if the right keyboard is setup.</li><li>Exit the app, launch any different app and make sure your normal keyboard is back.</li></ol><div>That's it. &nbsp;You're done. &nbsp;Congratulations.<br /><br />These instructions are based on the set of instructions I found at <a href="http://grokbase.com/t/gg/tasker/1292geqd8g/change-of-input-method-keyboard-with-tasker-and-plugin-secure-settings">grokbase</a>&nbsp;and in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/tasker/mAco_fbmh2c">google groups for tasker</a></div></div>

Thank you for this! This was exactly what I needed<br />Great instructions and well thought out. <br /><br />**to any noobs trying this, play around with the start and end tasks if you&#39;re switching keyboards between apps. <br />My quick paced setup (first try made the transition between keyboards VERY slow. This current set up doesn&#39;t hesitate, like its changed before the app keyboard even shows up. <br />not gonna include app names, just settings and keyboards.<br /><br />MMS pop up app- Start task- Kii keyboard, End task Samsung Keyboard <br /><br />MMS stock app- Start Samsung Keyboard, End task Samsung keyboard.</div>
