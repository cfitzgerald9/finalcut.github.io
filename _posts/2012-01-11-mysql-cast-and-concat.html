<span style="font-size: large;">CAST</span><br />This is just here to help me remember.  In MySQL if you want to CAST an int into a string you use: <br /><br /><pre class="sql" name="code">CAST(x AS CHAR)</pre>I had assumed it would be VARCHAR but I was wrong.  As a further <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/data-type-overview.html">reference here is info on all of the TYPES supported by MySQL</a>.  What I find interesting is the fact that MySQL does have a VARCHAR type but you can't cast an int to it.  Why Not?  In the end it doesn't matter too much; the CHAR option worked.  <br /><br />&nbsp;<span style="font-size: large;">CONCAT</span><br /><br />A similarly odd behavior is how you concatenate strings in MySQL. &nbsp;I had thought I would use &amp; or || but &nbsp;both of those return a 0 if you use them to concatenate. &nbsp;Instead you have to wrap all of the strings you want to concatenate up into a call to the CONCAT function like so:<br /><br /><br /><pre class="sql" name="code">CONCAT('http://www.rawlinson.us/blog', page_name, '/datafiles/?file_id', CAST(file_id AS VARCHAR)) as url</pre></div>
