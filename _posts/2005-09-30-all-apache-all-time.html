I have had apache 2 installed on my development machine for quite some time.  However, I have almost always used IIS when developing Coldfusion Apps (even though I had the Apache connector setup on Apache too).  Mostly I started IIS out of habit; plus 90% of my customers use IIS so it just made sense to use IIS all the time.<br /><br />Recently we started a very large PHP project and it has been done using Apache.  However, just because I'm working on that project doesn't mean I can neglect my other customers so I have been turning one server off and then starting up another (becuase I hate entering port numbers in a URL and I like just typing localhost/{website} or whatever.<br /><br />So this morning I moved all of my sites over to my Apahce development directory and setup some aliases for all (but one which needed a virtual server setup - OH so easy) and everything almost worked perfectly.<br /><br />I had to muck with some mappings as the directories I had mapped moved to the apache dev directory, I had to muck with one datasource (that has a placeholder access database), and I had to muck with some customtag paths.  Then it worked almost perfectly.  I had to go and delete the class files CF had generated and then restart CF and voila' everything worked perfectly.<br /><br />Total time of transition from IIS to Apache apx 20 minutes.<br /><br />This is handy cause now on one webserver I can develop in CF, PHP, and Ruby without any extra work.  I know you can use PHP with IIS and maybe you can Ruby - but it was fairly easy to get Ruby working with Apache so I don't have much desire to figure it out for IIS.  If you want to try Ruby out on a Windows machine with Apache I have a tutorial up at: <a href="http://rawlinson.us/blog/?page_id=309">http://rawlinson.us/blog/?page_id=309</a></div>

thanks for the tip - but using the extra domain names don't you have to add the virtual host in the apache conf file?<BR/><BR/>alot of my sites actually are subdirectories at different domains.  they are "sub-applications" at the domain.  mostly large organizations with tons of things going on, used internally (but with public access to the login screen) so the alias works pretty well for that scenario.</div>

If your workstation is WinNT (Win2k/WinXP) then you don't have to develop the sites from alias folders if you don't want to (ie. localhost/site1).  This will also help to eliminating the need to customize mappings and stuff (in other words, replicate the site as best as possible).<BR/><BR/>If you like you can make fake domain names in your host file (default is C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\host [ascii file]).  What I do is make a local subdomain for the site (so, if the live site is www.mysite.com, I make my dev site as local.devsite.com and point Apache to use it accordingly).<BR/><BR/>Example host file:<BR/>127.0.0.1  localhost<BR/>127.0.0.1  local.domain1.com<BR/>127.0.0.1  local.domain2.com<BR/><BR/>I added localhost to that list in case you still want to use it just like you are now (and use the newer method for newer projects).<BR/><BR/>After editing the file the change is instant (no reboot necessary).  If you add or change a record in Apache you'll need to restart Apache (as I'm sure you're aware).  No CF sessions will be lost.<BR/><BR/>- I have to thank Spike Milligan for the idea (Just trying to give credit when I can remember :) ).</div>

Paul, Apache run something like >65% of web servers, so it's definitely enterprise class.  It should run CF just fine, although for production you  will probably want to tweak and harden it a bit (there are entire books on the matter).<BR/>Email me offline if you'd like (trib at stephencollins dot org) and we'll see if we can't get you happening with Apache).</div>

Well, my setup isn't optimal for either but overall it feels pretty responsive.<BR/><BR/>I didn't do any wierd tweaks mainly because I don't know enough about apache to tweak it.<BR/><BR/>The initial sites I loaded loaded slowly.  But that is becaue of the initial compilation going on.  Once things were hit more than once it all seemed to go pretty well.<BR/><BR/>I would say the speed w/cf is about the same on my laptop.  However, places I do gain speed are:<BR/><BR/>1. faster service startup<BR/>2. faster service restart<BR/>3. faster to add virtual directories (Alias in apache conf file)<BR/><BR/>Other nice advantages so far are <BR/>1. super easy to setup for multiple "servers" using apache's virtual directory option in the conf file<BR/>2. i moved all my sites to c:\dev\websites - which is easier to type for me than c:\inetpub\wwwroot  - trivial true but still nice for me.<BR/>3. I can reproduce this setup fairly  easy on my home PC without needing a lisence of IIS - nice for consistency in my development environments.</div>

how does apache's performance stack up to iis w/cf? we just tried it the other day and it ran like a dog (out-of-the-box setup, no tweaking). does it require any modifications/behind kicking beyond running the web connector?<BR/><BR/>thanks.</div>
