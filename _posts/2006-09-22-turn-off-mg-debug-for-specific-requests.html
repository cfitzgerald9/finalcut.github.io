It's funny how when one person is looking for an answer to a problem it seems a bunch of other people are looking for the same thing, at the same time.  As it turns out this is exactly what happened to me today.<br /><br />I was working on creating a MG app that has some "AJAXy" goodness in it.  I want to leave the MG debug stuff on while I'm working (sometimes) but never want it to output in an "XML" view (that which is returned to the AJAX request).  I figured it had to be possible and sure enough some other people were just <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/8/22/Using-AJAX-with-ModelGlue">asking Ray Camden a couple days ago</a>.<br /><br />Thankfully, Jan Jannek, posted a comment reply with the answer:<br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br />&lt;cfset request.modelGlueSuppressDebugging = true /&gt; <br /></pre><br />Just stick that code in your XML view and debug output won't be shown.  Ray also posted a <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/9/18/Per-request-debugging-in-ModelGlue">blog entry</a> that covers this. I'm just recovering the topic in case anyone missed this then.</div>
