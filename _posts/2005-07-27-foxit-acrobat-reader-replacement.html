I thought I had already posted about this but I guess not.  If you use acrobat reader for viewing PDFs the time to stop is now. It is a bloated machine hogging beast that deserves nothing short of removal from your system.  There is a free alternative which can handle any PDF you throw at it, doesn't require installation, is less than 1MB in size, and opens nearly instantly.<br /><br />It's called <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php">Foxit Reader</a> and is made by a small company called <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/">Foxit Software</a>.  I don't work for them or have any affiliation with them at all.  In fact I just heard about Foxit Reader last month but can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to at least try it out.  Like I said it's free - and it does a damn fine job.</div>

You are correct John.  I was inspired to post about this year by a post at slashdot where everyone was complaining about having to downlaod a PDF and deal with Acrobat Reader and it's bloat/system hogging during initialization.<BR/><BR/>Most of the time I just need to read a PDF file so a good, lightweight reader, that lets me search the text is all I need.  Foxit fits that bill nicely.</div>

Hi Bill, there are many PDF readers out there -- the file format is well-described -- the most famous alternate is probably that built into recent versions of the Macintosh operating system, but even old standbys like GhostScript can work.<BR/><BR/>The key is which features they cut. If you're just looking at a PDF file, you may not need the document-workflow components... best tool depends on the task, agreed?<BR/><BR/>jd/mm</div>
