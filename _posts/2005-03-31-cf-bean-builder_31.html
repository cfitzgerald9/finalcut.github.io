If you are working with CF and OOP and in that work are using Beans then this link is for you - <a href="http://blog.maestropublishing.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=A5EC4D60-B152-F6D1-4F1E634CBA2D5048" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">http://blog.maestropublishing<wbr>.com/index.cfm?mode=entry<wbr>&amp;entry=A5EC4D60-B152-F6D1<wbr>-4F1E634CBA2D5048</a><br /><br /> It is a full fledged bean builder written by <a title="" target="" href="http://blog.maestropublishing.com/">Peter Farrell</a> written entirely in html and javascript.  It will generate the entire CF code you need for a bean.  Just make sure you review the generated code to make sure it deals with non "string" parameters the way you want.<br /><br /> He has an online version to demonstrate its capabilities at <a href="http://blog.maestropublishing.com/mach-ii_beaner.htm" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">http://blog.maestropublishing<wbr>.com/mach-ii_beaner.htm</a> however he asks that if you want to use the bean builder that you download from the first link and run it locally.<br /><br /> If your not sure what your doing when you get to the builder, click on the "Show Example Bean" button.  It will make everything pretty clear at that point.</div>
