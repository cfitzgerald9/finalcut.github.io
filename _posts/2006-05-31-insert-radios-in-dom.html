<p>In my prior posts about an IE DOM Gotcha I talked about how to insert a radio button into the DOM dynamically in a fashion that worked in both IE and Firefox but still failed to work properly in Opera.  The problem wasn't getting the radio button in place - but rather getting it to function as a radio button.  The initial problem in IE was that the radio button couldn't be selected.  Once the IE/FF solution was found the same problem persisted in Opera.  Today, a guy named Torbjorn Gyllebring sent me a function that he believes takes care of all of our radio-insertion needs.<br /><br />I honestly haven't had a chance to test it out yet - but I didn't see anything alarming in a casual glance.  Please try it out and see how it works for you.  I'd be particularly interested in hearing how it works in various Mac and Linux browsers.<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="jscript"><br />-----[ Browswer.js follows ]-----<br /><br />/*<br /> Browser facade to smooth over the worst misstakes that IE does.<br />*/<br /><br />function Browser(){}<br /><br />Browser.initIE = function()<br />{<br /> Browser.createInput = function(name)<br /> {<br />  var element = document.createElement("&lt;input name='" + name + "'&gt;");<br />  if(element.toString() == "[object HTMLElement]")//detect Opera masquerade<br />  {<br />   Browser.init();<br />   return Browser.createInput(name);<br />  }<br />  else//skip future checks<br />   Browser.createInput = function(name){ return <br />document.createElement("&lt;input name='" + name + "'&gt;");}<br />  return element;<br /> }<br />}<br /><br />Browser.init = function()<br />{<br /> Browser.createInput = function(name)<br /> {<br />  var element = document.createElement("input");<br />  element.name = name;<br />  return element;<br /> }<br />}<br /><br />if(navigator.appName == "Microsoft Internet Explorer")<br /> Browser.initIE();<br />else<br /> Browser.init();<br /></pre></div>
