If you read my prior post about my troubles with Ubuntu during my first week you will know I have been having troubles with my shift key in the Citrix Client.  90% of my development time is spent in the citrix client so getting this resolved was a deal breaker.  Fortunately, today, I found a fix!<br /><br />The Citrix Support Website had a posting on <a href="http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX110281">SHIFT Key Fails Using RDP in a Java Client Session</a> however it says it only applies from a windows environment.  Fortunately for me they are wrong because this fix also takes care of the problem from my Linux environment.  Sweet!<br /><br />In case the solution ever gets taken down here is the basic gist:<br /><br />1. Launch your Remote Desktop Client. <br />2. When you get to the point where you are supposed to pick a computer to connect to hit the "advanced options" button<br />3. On the advanced options dialog select the "Local Resources" tab<br />4. On the local resources tab under Keyboard &gt; Apply Windows key combinations, select On the local computer.<br /><br />That's it.  Now you won't be able to alt-tab inside the remote computer BUT you will be able to use the shift key, and frankly, I think shift is far more important than alt-tab.</div>
