Last week I posted about a procedural way of maintaining a dynamic breadcrumb trail on your site. It had to be done that way so it could support CF 5. However, for the future I think it would be better to have a component that takes care of this - and thus makes it far more reusable. In that vein I have built the first version of breadcrumb.cfc<br /><br />When I posted about the procedural method I put a whole bunch of code up. I'm not going to do that this time. Instead, I have actually assembled a sample application that you can download and try out yourself. There is a README.txt file - please read it. All you should have to do is update the applicaiton.cfm file to point to a valid client storage dsn and the sample app will work.<br /><br />Anway <a href="http://blog.rawlinson.us/sourcecode/breadcrumb.zip">here is the sample app</a>.  All of the code is available under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU public license</a>.</div>

You can find it hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/finalcut/ColdBreadCrumbs.. I think I refactored it a little when I put it on there but I don&#39;t really remember.<br /><br />I know the code works, it&#39;s still in use in a project.</div>

I'd suggest not using this.  You should probably roll your own since you have a clearly defined structure to your site that is stored in the db.<BR/><BR/>This is for sites whose structure is not in a database.<BR/><BR/>Since yours is you can do a few things.<BR/><BR/>1. When the applicaiton is first loaded, load the site map in memory (a CF structure would work well) then use it to get the page's heirarcy when a page is loaded and show the trail.  This has the advantage that the DB won't be hit each time a page is loaded just to get the heirarchy - especially considering the site won't change alot.  When it does you save the page and update the in memory structure so that new pages are automatically accounted for.<BR/><BR/>2. Or you can load the pages breadcrumb on each page load by querying the DB.<BR/><BR/>3. Or you can choose a hybrid approach.  On page load check your sitemap structure to see if the current page has been visited yet.  If so then grab the data from the structure.  If not then load the trail from the DB and display it and store it in the sitemap structure so it is availble on next page load.</div>

This is nice, thanks for making it available!<BR/>I'd like to use it to show where I am in the site as opposed to where I have been.<BR/>My site is a database CMS with typical parent/child sections, then an article or a product can be drilled down to and displayed.<BR/>What suggestions do you have.</div>
