For a long time I have been posting really ugly code snippets on this blog but thankfully, as of today, that is no longer a problem.  Thanks to this post about a <a href="http://yacoding.blogspot.com/2008/05/how-to-add-syntax-highlight-to-blogger.html">syntaxhighlighter javascript</a> and this other guys "<a href="http://blog.tech-cats.com/2007/10/syntax-highlighting-for-coldfusion.html">coldfusion brush</a>" for the same script my site now has nicely formatted and highlighted code.<br /><br />The script is called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter</a> and it works very well, even with blogger blogs like this one.  I am now highlighting all of my CF, PHP, RUBY, Javascript, C#, SQL, and Java code exampmles.  It may take a while for me to go back through my old posts and update the code but I'll get there eventually.<br /><br />The first link in this post has nice instructions for setting up the script.  The CF brush is a little hidden but he has a link right to the actual <a href="http://opensourceprojects.googlecode.com/svn/dpSyntaxHighlighterColdFusionBrush/trunk/compressed/shBrushColdFusion.js">brushes compressed source</a> as well.</div>
