Knowing the value of a database plan I pretty much always use the &lt;cfqueryparam&gt; tag inside queries with variable parameters. However, recently I encountered a problem with the &lt;cfqueryparam&gt; tag and ColdFusion 5. You may be wondering why I'm still using CF5 and the answer is - its what that specific customer is using. So, now that I have justified my use of CF 5, and explained why I can't use MX on this project, I'll explain the problem with some code.<br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br />&lt;cfset someListOfIds = "1,2,3,4,5,,7,10,21"&gt;<br /><br />&lt;cfquery name="someQuery" datasource="somedsn"&gt;<br />SELECT * FROM someTable where id IN &lt;cfqueryparam cfsqltype="CF_SQL_INTEGER" value="#someListOfIds#" list="true" /&gt;<br />&lt;/cfquery&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />On CFMX this runs without a problem. But, on CF5 it does not. Instead it crashes saying that I can't pass in a "" value as an integer in my list. (I would put some official error text here but I don't have it handy sorry.)<br /><br />The problem arises with the list. You will notice that between the 5 and 7 of the list is an empty element. Now, CF ALWAYS treats that list as a 8 element list, ignoring the empty elements, right? Well, not in CF 5 with the &lt;cfqueryparam&gt; tag. Instead it treats it as a 9 element list and tries to pass in the empty string value. Because of that, and because the application using this might have empty element lists being passed around I now have to introduce a new function to strip out empty elements.<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br />function listDropEmpty(list){<br />    var newList = "";<br />    var i = 1;<br />    var tArray = ListToArray(list);<br />    for(i=1; i LTE arrayLen(tArray); i=i+1){<br />        newList = listAppend(newList,tArray[i]);<br />    }<br />    return newList;<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br />With this simple function I am able to drop the empty elements. Another option I could use instead is ListSort as it returns a sorted list and will thus drop the empty element. I suppose it is just a matter of preference and the performance. I don't know how one performs against the other. It seems like ListSort might take longer since it is actually doing quite a bit more than my listDropEmpty option but I haven't tested this.<br /><br />So beware lists and &lt;cfqueryparam&gt; in CF 5!</div>
