I don't need anything fancy.  I don't want to spend any money.  But I would like a decent software modeling program - something I can use to draw UML diagrams specifically.<br /><br />I'd be happy if it just amounted to a set of shapes for OpenOffice draw, or was a plugin for Eclipse.  However these aren't a requirement.  I can always fall back to MS and reinstall Visio (we have a company license, but I'd prefer not to - just because I'm stubborn about MS Office).  <br /><br />If you have any suggestions or recommendations please leave a comment!<br /><br />Thanks</div>

thanks - another one I am looking at is <A HREF="http://www.umlet.com" REL="nofollow">umlet</A><BR/><BR/>The website sucks, the documentation is horrible, but it looks like it will do the job quickly and easily.<BR/><BR/>If you decide to look at it just note that you have to have JVM 1.5 installed (at the command line type java -version to see what version you have).</div>

You could use either <A HREF="http://argouml.tigris.org/" REL="nofollow">argouml</A> or <A HREF="http://dia-installer.sourceforge.net/" REL="nofollow">dia</A>.<BR/>Both are free.</div>

Have you tried Dia? <BR/><BR/>http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia/<BR/><BR/>It's similar to Visio...</div>
