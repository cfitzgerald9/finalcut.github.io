<div class='post'>
I have held off posting this until today because I didn’t want to infuse the post with venom. It probably won’t work.<br /><br />Last week I went to BW3 (Buffalo, Wings, and Weck aka Buffalo Wild Wings) a chain of greasy food restaurants that specializes in Buffalo Chicken Wings. They have over 10 different spices and flavors of wings; however they are all really, really greasy and my stomach doesn’t tolerate them very well so when I go I always order their “Jerk Chicken Sandwich” a kind of spicy sandwich done in a Caribbean style. BW3 is always kind of slow and one of us always has a problem with our order but this last trip was kind of special in the ranks of “bad trips”. Their website is http://www.bw3.com - I won’t link to them because their website throws annoying audio at you.<br /><br />There were six of us, I was fourth in line. The two few guys ordered salads with chicken breast chunks on them while the third ordered a plate of wings. I ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich as always. The next two guys ordered something, I don’t remember what. We sat down to wait for our food and slowly but surely each guys food came out - except mine. All five guys were eating and we were all chatting having a good time while I waited on my sandwich. 10 minutes passed and no Sandwich. 15 passed so I went up to the cashier and asked her to check on it - make sure the order didn’t get lost in the lunch hour rush. I heard her talking to the guy in the kitchen and clearly heard her say, “You burnt it?” then they went back to talking. A few seconds later she came out and told me it was just about to be finished they just had to take it off the grill,the bun was already prepped. I said cool and sat back down. Another five minutes passed and by now everyone else was done. I didn’t want to wait anymore so I went back to the cashier and told her I wanted to cancel my order and she said I had to wait for the manager. Fine, no problem I said, and I stood to the side and waited a couple minutes, the kitchen manager came out looking tired and in no mood to deal with me and then my experience with BW3 went from bad to worse.<br /><br />He looked at me, and said, “It’s your fault, you shouldn’t have ordered chicken.” I said, “What? My Fault? This is a chicken restaurant isn’t it? You do cook chicken here don’t you?” I went from impatient to angry in about 2 seconds. The Jerk Chicken Sandwich consists of a standard, non breaded, chicken breast. The same kind that was chopped up all over the other 2 guys’ salads. What problem could there have been making my sandwich? I asked the manager this and he said “well we don’t keep these things pre-cooked, when you order them they are frozen and we have to cook them from there.” “It takes over 20 minutes?” I asked. I said I had been there about 30 minutes and didn’t think it should take so long, I mean all five guys I came with had ordered, had their food prepared, and they had eaten it. He told me I was wrong I hadn’t been there 30 minutes then walked away from me (I still didn’t have a refund). I said “what? Now I’m hungry and a Liar?” He didn’t reply. Instead he went into the kitchen and came back out 10-20 seconds later and told me my order ticket said 12:10 (it was then 12:35) - So I said, “Ok, 25 minutes, big deal, I want my money back.” So, he got another manager to get my refund for me and he went back to the kitchen without saying anything else to me.<br /><br />The second manager processed my refund, handed me my receipt, and told me to keep a hold of it in case the charge showed up. That was it. No apology for my wasted lunch break or for the bad service. Just here’s your receipt keep a hold of it in case we messed up again.<br /><br />I already didn’t care much for BW3’s food - but now I can guarantee that I will never go to any BW3 anywhere again. All they have managed to do is push me (and my family) away as customers. My co-workers, when I am with them, won’t go back to BW3 again (and who knows, maybe they won’t go even if I’m not there). We go out to eat everyday. It’s crazy to think BW3, in Huntington WV can afford to just throw customers away. This isn’t NYC where people can throw away customers forever and never run out of new customers. This is a small town and I will be, and have been, telling everyone I know about the horrid customer service at BW3.<br /><br />Finally, even though they don’t deserve it, here is a tip for BW3. Don’t blame your customers when you can’t cook a simple chicken breast. Don’t call them liars, and finally, apologize when you screw up.</div>

It&#39;s not a crappy attitude. You really aren&#39;t anything special, so stop trying to slander Buffalo Wild Wings because you&#39;re sandwich took too long. Boohoo...  It&#39;s more like, we have no respect for people that set out to complain on a public forum because they&#39;re upset. Take it up with the store, not the internet. And if it really does ruin you&#39;re thought of Buffalo Wild Wings, then fine, don&#39;t come back, we&#39;d be lucky not to have you. I&#39;m so glad me thinking you&#39;re an idiot, can make you hate the whole restaurant. I used to work at Chili&#39;s, go hate them too?</div>

It isn&#39;t the time that made the entire experience suck - it was the managers attitude; one you seem to share.<br /><br />Fried Food by default = Greasy Food so yes, your food is greasy; deal with it.<br /><br />Thanks for stopping by and illustrating the crappy attitude of people at BW3 and for confirming my opinion of the restaurant.</div>

I work at BDubs, one, I don&#39;t appreciate you saying it&#39;s greasy food, it&#39;s just fried food. There&#39;s 1000 stores, and just because you had one bad experiance at this one, doesn&#39;t entitle you to slander the hole company. <br /><br /> Secondly, let me tell you, the jerk chicken sandwhich does take, no less than 15 minutes. It&#39;s a chicken breast that&#39;s seasoned and grilled, where as, the chicken on your friends salads? That&#39;s precooked chicken, it&#39;s already made, it just simple diced chicken. That takes 1 minute in a microwave.<br /><br />And for future reference, we can afford to throw customers away, considering bdubs does 10,000 dollars or more a day, and you&#39;re sand which is what, 8.39? You aren&#39;t anything special.</div>

I work at buffalo wild wings in ypsilanti-- and let me say.. i HATE it! everything that is described here about management is true.. everywhere!! throughout the country the management is lazy and does nothing! they make their servers do all the dirty work. when costumers ask for a manager they always say &quot;ugh&quot;. managers do not do shit there! they are too young and SOOO irresponsible! plus all they do is flirt with the servers and hang around them all day at work, then get drunk at the bar after their shift with those servers, even though they have wives and families. i am about to quit..it is horrible... but in regards with the whole things showing up on your bill that you did not order- sometimes we have to ring it in, in order for the kitchen to give it to us.. so that&#39;s the reason...</div>

We like the wings and decided to try a new BW opening and support the chanin.  Big mistake- placed an order in the restaurant- 2 hours no wings nothing- service and management equally bad!  Thornton, at Grant and 100th location definitely needs a better management!</div>

We tried the BW3 at 100th and Grant the service was awful!  The management really does not have a clue how to run a wing stop!  2 Hours wait and still did not get our food!  Service and staff were equally bad!  New opening was hopeful but did not open with prepared staff!</div>

A minor update: We went back to the local BW3 recently since we heard they were under new management.<BR/><BR/>The food came out correctly but this time we all had to wait well over 30 minutes to get the food.  It just isn't a good lunchtime option.<BR/><BR/>However, the staff was generally friendly and the food came out,for all of us, as ordered.  I tried a salad this time since the salads were so fast for everyone the previous time.  It was still slow for me.<BR/><BR/>My friend ordered boneless wings and for whatever reason was given two orders (he didn't have to pay for the second).</div>

wow... seems like a mixed batch of experiences.  I've actually been a fan of B-dubs for a long time and have always had a good experience at the franchises I frequent.  Sorry you had such lousy experiences...and I don't blame you for not patronizing the place again.  Customer service and good management can always overcome slow arriving orders or screw-ups.<BR/><BR/>There is one KFC (not really a fair comparison, but bear with me)... close to me and they never have a particular chicken wing of mine cooked when I go.  They always have to toss in a special batch.  So, needless to say; it takes a while; a little over 5 minutes to be exact (and that's just cook time).  HOWEVER, the management there always gives me a free soft drink and something else to nibble on (a chicken strip or pop corn chicken) to pass the time as I wait.<BR/><BR/>So, with customer service like this...sure I always go back.<BR/><BR/>I've had bad experiences in other restaurants, but have almost always come away with some sort of resolution to prevent me from "boycotting" the place again.<BR/><BR/>Sounds like poor management, even worse training in customer service, and just overall disregard for customer satisfaction.<BR/><BR/>From an avid B-dub fan... sorry, and I don't blame you.</div>

They are not all bad....If anyone ever makes it to the Cleveland area, stop at Bdubz in Broadview Heights to see Sean in the bar. He is by far THE BEST you will ever see. He is fantastic, very nice, ever so prompt and always one step ahead!!!!!!!!!   (Paul is great too). Sean is their best asset there!!!!!! Definately the Best in Class!</div>

I live in Huntington and go to b-dubs three times a week usually.  I've never had any problems although I sit at the bar and the food is ordered through the bartender.  Thursday and Saturday nights can get a little crowded, but you can expect that.  Had lots of great times there!!</div>

In defense of BW3: I think the food is good, chicken is greasy by nature, deal with it. It sounds like thier management team is crappy, contact the LOCAL owner and ask why service was not up to BW3 REQUIREMENTS. Well maybe you should have asked for a little less JERK next time.</div>

Me and my family went to the BW3 in Huntington WV and got some of the WORST service ever! We had to wait for our food over an hour then they got our orders wrong twice. We asked to talk to the manger and he told us we could just pay for our drinks and leave but we got our MOST of our food and the manger came back threw down the to-go boxes and told us he was there to collect the check my dad said I'll pay when I get done eating. <BR/>It was awful! We haven't been back since. We love the food but it will probaly be a while before we go back.</div>

Been going to the local Perrysburg, OH. BWW since they opened the doors. My wife and I enjoy the atmosphere and have developed a great rapport with some of the employees. It was not unusual to see us and our friends in there at least twice a week this college football season but after Saturday we will never spend another dime in there. <BR/><BR/>This all goes back to what I believe it was the first week of college football this season. They had placed an 8 person hot-tub in their lobby and posted a sign announcing a raffle. The raffle was to be help during the Ohio State / Michigan Game. On at least 3 occasions during the season, the staff told us that we would need to be present for the drawing in order to win. Last Thursday the GM approached us while we were filling out our entries and said “you know that you will have to be here for the game in order to win” and we told here that we fully intended to be here with our normal group of 8 to 12.<BR/><BR/>The raffle took place at half-time and they picked the first entry looked it over and without any explanation picked a second entry. They announced the name of the winner and without much delay they realized the person was not there so they would be contacted. Of course we began to protest regarding the rules, which could not be found posted anywhere, and then we were told that you did not need to be present to win in contradiction to everything that we have been told over the last 10 weeks. <BR/><BR/>Several of the servers that we had built great rapport with also agreed with our protest but were powerless to do anything about it. It was obvious that others that were present outside our party had been told the same thing. Needless to say I believe that something underhanded had taken place at that point and all of our trust and good feelings towards this place had disappeared with a silly raffle.<BR/><BR/>To sum things up, the BWW in Perrysburg was a great place to get together with friends and have a few beers while enjoying college football and other sports. Some of the college kids that worked in there were great but the food is mediocre at best. We never went there for the food it was more of a Cheers-on-steroids atmosphere for us but now we will be spending all of our Kids college money somewhere else.<BR/><BR/>BWW, You Lose!</div>

Just mailed this to corporate and local.<BR/><BR/>To Whom It May Concern:<BR/><BR/>I just left your new location in Ypsilanti, MI and wanted to give you some feedback.  The time was 11:50 AM, Friday November 16, 2007.<BR/><BR/>We were seated quickly.  We placed our order:<BR/>6 spicy garlic wings<BR/>boneless honey bbq chicken lunch combo/ diet coke<BR/>chicken tender lunch combo/ diet coke/ Cajun spice on the chips/ sweet bbq dipping sauce<BR/><BR/>Our drinks were brought to us and the table next to us (which was seated after us) placed their order.  The table next to us received their drinks and then their meals before our meal was served.  When the waitress brought them their meal she said she would check on ours because it was taking so long.<BR/><BR/>When our meal came it was brought by someone other than our waitress.  At this point our drinks were gone as it took 25 minutes to bring the food.  At first glance the meal looked good.  I dipped my tender into the sauce and found it to be quite hot and a little fruity; I was brought the mango habanero instead of the sweet bbq, luckily I don’t mind hot sauces but I was sharing them with my wife and she can’t handle the hotter sauces.  My wife’s boneless wings were dry and hardly had any sauce on them.<BR/><BR/>I tried to flag down 3 different employees who all conveniently looked the other way.  Finally the 4th employee came over and went to look for our waitress.  While waiting for her to come over I realized that there was no Cajun spice on my chips, not a big deal except your waitress was the one who suggest I get the Cajun spice.  When our waitress finally came back we asked her to bring us sweet bbq dipping sauce to replace the unasked for habanero sauce and some honey bbq sauce for the very dry boneless wings.<BR/><BR/>At this point we were more annoyed then anything, bring us the right sauce and we’ll be good.  Instead she brings the table next to us refills on their drinks while we wait an additional 5 minutes (with our food in front of us getting cold mind you) for the correct sauces.  Remember, our drinks are still empty, so I go ahead and refill our glasses out of the machine on my own.  <BR/><BR/>Now we are getting a little upset so when our sauces come and I say so to the waitress when she asks how is everything.  Of course she apologizes and blames the kitchen for the mix up on the food.  We say no problem and finish our meal, which is now cold.<BR/><BR/>We finish our meal and proceed to wait another 15 minutes for our waitress to bring us our bill.  She knows that we have not been happy so she brings us a complete itemization to show us that it was the kitchens fault for the mix up on the food and not hers.  I say to her that is fine but the drinks don’t come from the kitchen and it is ridiculous that the table that came in after us is long gone and the party that sat down after them is already getting their food.<BR/><BR/>She apologizes, I say don’t worry about it and take the bill.  Now is when I have had enough.  I was charged for extra dipping sauce, even though the wrong one had been brought to begin with; my wife was charged for her dipping sauce, even though the boneless wings were dry as could be; and I was charged for the 6 spicy garlic wings even though I had given the waitress a coupon ahead of time for a free order of wings.<BR/><BR/>So, to sum it all up, we experienced:<BR/>Very sub par service<BR/>The wrong food<BR/>Mediocre food<BR/>And charged too much<BR/><BR/>As you can tell, this was one of our worst dining experiences ever.  I have been to several BW3’s and have always been satisfied with the food and service.  I understand that you have just opened but, I was under the impression that most of your staff had experience.  I wouldn’t say that I won’t be coming back, I enjoyed the one downtown and hope that this was just an aberration, I just thought that the management might want some feedback.</div>

Disappointed Employee~<BR/><BR/>    To the original post, I'm sorry to hear of the service u recived. I've worked for the company for 7 yrs and have seen many shity managers come and go. To even argue or make excuses and not take care of the problem is awful management skills. A full refund should have been given without question and comps for a future visit. <BR/><BR/> As far as food times the company shoots for 15 min ticket times, 25+ mins for that sandwich is outrageous. I understand that people think its fast food but it is NOT. AT my B-dubs our kitchen staff is pretty shity not gonna lie, but never on a lunch shift would we see a ticket time like that unless the cook had no arms. <BR/><BR/>  The Jerk sandwich takes the longest to cook out of all items cause of the charcrust thats on it takes 14-18 mins, so there goes the 15 min times they want. If fast food is what u want Mc Donalds and Burger King is what your looking for. <BR/><BR/>  For the volume guy~<BR/>Are u for real? If so u need to un-tuck your wang from between your legs and slap the shit out of yourself. For local sports no matter where you go they're #1 priority. I dont even think I need to say more. ~cough~ Ass ~cough~<BR/><BR/>  ID GUY~<BR/>  Yes this is crap i agree, but it is illegal to server someone without a valid ID or that has alcohol restrictions. Being carded at your age should be a compliment, no offense. I went on vacation with my old man in May he turned 50 and was carded 2 times in Coloardo and he wasnt pissed at all,ease up buddy or you might have a heart attack. J/K <BR/><BR/>  For people who blame the service staff for your food taking for ever~<BR/>   Dont blame the people who take the order they dont cook the damn food. I get so sick of people who blame the person who takes care of the table.For $hit sake you people are such assholes dont give a shit about anyone but yourself "God this server sucks wheres my food". Hmm let me think while im ringing in your order getting you a drink every time its getting low and taking care of my other tables ill hop back to the kitchen and cook your food while im at it you prick. I wish i could say that shit to a guest, Its more like "Can i kiss your ass a little more for 15%" if im lucky. <BR/><BR/>  Well thanks for your time hope I caught your eye for a min and I hope everyones next experience at B-dubs is a great 1. "Thank you come again" <BR/>                B-Dubs4LIfe<BR/> (-,-)y---~ o0</div>

Hey Bill, Thanks for starting this thread! I'm sure that there are many. I just got done writing a letter to Buffalo, Wild Wings And Grill. They by the way changed their name. But everyone know's them a BW3. I grew up in Ohio not far from where they started. I really wish they were something we could be proud of but I have pretty much had the same experience there since the early 80's. Wether it is franchised or not, it still carries the same wasted college student half-assed is ok mentality. The only reason I go there is that I get off work at 11 and no one is in there and they're still serving and since I already know it's gonna take 20 to 30 min to get my food I've usually planned on having a beer or three while I wait. And I can tell you that my experience has always been the same at six locations in Columbus, Akron, Cinci etc...The food is slow!<BR/> especially considering what it is. And the service is slow and inefficient. I haven't really run in to rudeness but just stupidity. The bar is what's really bad. They do almost no training. Now I can understand getting idiots as counter help and waiters but bartenders can usually make a decent buck. You'd think w/ the draft beer selection and volume of business they do that they would put some effort into this but when they are busy, it takes 20 minutes to get a drink too. Not to mention they have zero product knowledge. I've seen a couple of comments from Las Vegas; I would say that Vegas has a much higher level of service than the midwest in general and that probably accounts for most of the difference they experience as opposed to the fact that it is a franchise. Franchise fees are high. Part of the reason for that is training and support which they obviously do very poorly. Btw, I have been involved in all facets of the bar and restaurant industry. Excuse making is just that. The sole reason that Bww survives is the stores are nice and offer a place that has sports viewing. The rest is a mess. Also, I think that for the midwest the prices are high for the quality of food they serve. Combined with crappy service and slow, inefficient delivery it's a rip-off. But like a lot of over-priced crap you still end up using it because there's no alternative. It would be very easy to systematically put them out of business if a quality restauranteur was to be so inclined. That said, I will say one thing in their favor - it is pretty expensive to set up in a mall and have all the alternate sports. One note in regard to the person who had the channel turned. Although one response was unnecessarily rude, I do think you have to expect this. but that is the reason the newer sports  bars have multiple environments so that they can have several games. But if the home team is on and you get to see an alternate game that is pretty good. I can tell you that in Columbus; you will have to search to find something other than the Buckeyes. And you'll pretty much get a response like, "Why would you want to see anything else?" - silly I think but that's the way it is.</div>

So you order from a line at a cashier and then get your food? As in fast food? Thats weird. In Las Vegas, NV BW3 is a chain of sit down restaurants. That might explain why it is greasy for you too. The service has been bad for me a few times though. Nothing terrible just the usual that happens from time to time anywhere and I have never had a problem with management. Management has reduced our bill without us even mentioning the poor service a few times. If you aren't too burnt over the whole thing give another restaurant a shot.</div>

Friday 11/02/07 we waited over two hours for our food to be served to our group of 8 adults. This was the second vsisit where we had late or non existent food. We kept receiving excuses from the waitress and manager as to why it was taking so long. Tables that came in after we did received their food before we did. The food when it arrived was cold as if it had been sitting around. I asked for the franchise owners name and was told that he speaks with no one and they have never seen him. His name or contact information were no where to be found. As you state, BW3's coroporate has no contact information. BW3's and there franchisee's insulate themselves and do not want to deal with their customer base. Their lack of responsibility will keep us from going to any of their locations. They do not hold their franchisee's to any sort of standards and could care less.<BR/><BR/>Duke<BR/>Cincinnati</div>

Bill, I hear ya barkin' brother....this is my ''beef'' with the store in Louisville, Ky in Jeffersontown. Management thinks they are always right and all powerful there as you will read below. These are emails that I have been sending and receiving the last couple of days since my last, and I mean LAST, visit. B.K. p.s. you may have to read from the bottom up as that is how they were copied to here, I think.....<BR/><BR/>You made my point for me. You stated that ‘’the law states that serving an UNDERAGE INDIVIDUAL will result in fines and possible jail time”. It is quite evident that I am not UNDERAGE and to just card everybody, when you know good and well they are not UNDERAGE, is ludicrous at best. I can understand you not wanting to be fined and all, but going overboard and carding everyone smacks of Gestapo like tactics. I was in the military for 6 years and was rarely, if ever carded, and I was 18 years old at the time.  <BR/>You have the right to do as you please and I have the right to not frequent your restaurant. I shall agree to disagree. Your first sentence, ‘’Obviously WE have offended you greatly by the situation on Friday’’, is not necessarily correct. ‘’we’’ should be replaced by ‘’I’’, for the smart aleck retort to my saying something about all the political correctness these days. That is what really bothered me, as much as being ‘’carded’’ at 48 years old. Your flippant remark about me not saying something next time was very unprofessional coming from a ‘’general manager’’. Without the customers, a restaurant/bar is non- existent. Good day, Brian Kaiser<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>Dear Brian,<BR/>    Obviously we have offended you greatly by the situation on Friday.  I am actually in charge of teaching Responsible Alcohol Service to employees and managment for the company and that is why the email you sent was referred back to my store.  I have attached a copy of the local laws that I use as a guidline for teaching my classes.  You will note that the law states that serving an underage individual will result in fines and possible jail time.  I preach to students to not serve without an ID because it against the law to serve anybody without ID whether they are 21 or 100.  I understand that "common sense" would dictate that you are well over the serving age but we cannot take any risks in the business we are in.  We cannot risk a multi-million dollar lawsuit...could your company withstand something like that?  With that said, we are just doing our jobs the way we are told and if that offends you, then I am sorry.  We will not change our policies based on guests who do not like them because this puts us at a very serious risk.  On the attachment, you can contact the local government and they will tell you whether we are operating within state laws and regulations.  I have contacted them myself, as well several police officers, about this particular situation.   <BR/>    As for other establishments, I cannot speak for them.  They may not have policies in place or maybe they don't care.  Like I said, I cannot speak for their business.  I know that I run mine with the utmost respect for the law, my employees, and my guests.  And again, I am sorry if this offended you.<BR/> <BR/>Sincerly,<BR/>JEN Carmichael<BR/>Training General Manager, Managing Partner<BR/>Buffalo Wild Wings<BR/><BR/>Sent: Saturday, October 27, 2007 9:41 AM<BR/>Subject: Re: Buffalo Wild Wings<BR/><BR/>Michael, I certainly thought I was going to actually send my email to someone higher up, who actually mattered. If I would have wanted to talk to you, the Assistant General manager I would have just asked for you when I was offended by your Œ‚General‚‚ manager (Jan Carmichael) flippant comments. Why would your opinion matter to me, after I have already Œ‚talked‚‚ to her about it, with her less than friendly reply, and the regional corporate guy. I want to talk to somebody who matters.  You can sugar coat it any way you want, it still is an infringement on my rights as a paying customer. I‚m sure I‚m not the only person to ever complain about this Œ‚law of reasonable alcohol service‚‚. Catchy name for bugging good, law abiding, legal aged folks. <BR/><BR/>Why is it that when I frequent ALL other food establishments that I‚m not bothered with showing my I.D.? I‚ll tell you why. It‚s because I‚m 48 years old and I look it. Common Sense dictates that when a human being looks at me they can tell that I am of legal drinking age and over 21 years old and they don‚t have to feel like an idiot asking to see my I.D. What ever happened to good ole common sense? Send me an email address to one of the corporate people that might have a real answer and who might actually listen to reason. Thanks, Brian Kaiser <BR/><BR/>Dear Brian,<BR/><BR/>My name is Michael Swift, and I am the Assistant General Manager of the Stonybrook Buffalo Wild Wings.  Since you have already talked to our Regional Manager and General Manager about your disappointment I hope I can explain the situation.  The law of responsible alcohol service states that you must card any customer that looks under the age of 40.  To make sure all of our employees are making the right judgment call on our customers ages, we ask them to card every customer that orders alcoholic beverages.  This rule is not intended to make any of our customers mad or upset, it is put into place to make sure our restaurant is 100% compliant in responsible alcohol service.  As a business with high risk and liability for beverage control, our managers feel more comfortable with checking I.D's of all patrons.  The ABC and Corporate Buffalo Wild Wings send in secret shoppers and undercover police officers to ensure we are being 100% responsible for the service of alcohol.  So when my employee asked for your I.D, he or she was doing the job we (management) have asked them to do.  I do apologize sincerely for your inconvenience and we were in no way trying to make you feel uncomfortable.  We are just trying to make sure we are serving alcohol correctly to all of our customers.  I hope I have convinced you to return to our restaurant in knowing that we are looking out for all of our customers well-being and safety.  Thank you for your comments and for your business.<BR/><BR/>Michael Swift</div>

I live in Dayton, OH and I used to eat at BW3 a couple of times a week. They used to have wonderful service and that stop-your-heart deep fried flavor that I love. Anyhoo.. the past couple of months it seems that the majority of the good servers have left, and now they are stocked with brainless twits who think they are going to get a tip just for flirting with me. So, last week I stop in, and it is fairly busy. I always take that into consideration, and I end up ordering anyways. This is around 6:30pm. I notice a group of 6 teens that come in and order around 6:45. Their food (and I mean ALL of their food) is on their table by 7pm. I, however, am still waiting. My waitress hasn't even come back by my table at this point either. Finally she happens to stroll past my table and I inquire about my food. She flips her hair, and gives me some spiel about them being busy. I say "ok, but if my food isn't out here in 5 minutes, cancel my order". So finally around 7:25 they bring my food out. Cold. I absolutely lose it. So over sashays my waitress, cooing, "Would you like another beer?" This time I go ballistic. I toss the cold-ass chicken on the floor and head straight into the kitchen to ask for a manager. This dimwit stands there explaining how busy it is, and I basically call him everything under the sun. My girlfriend is still sitting at the table eating her food and I just leave, about ripping the front door of the hinge when I do. Apparently after I left, the manager comes over, apologizes to my girl, gives her order for free and a $20 certificate for the next time. So I reluctantly go back, and my service has been stellar ever since. They know how much money I spend in that place, and I feel that I should be taken care of accordingly. If they screw me over, they will hear about it.</div>

two anonymous cowards in a row who are brave enough to insult on the net but not brave enough to leave their names. Typical..<BR/><BR/>To the first guy - it is obvious why you "USED" to be a manager.  With your people skills you were probably fired.<BR/><BR/>To the second "genius" perhaps you don't know that the BW3 initially stood for Buffalo Wings and Weck.  Weck is bread and, I know this might surprise you, but a chicken sandwich features the two things BW3 was named for - chicken and bread.  Wow.. amazing isn't it?<BR/><BR/>Get a life folks.  If you are going to stop by to insult me at least leave your name so I can return the favor.</div>

I used to be a gm at BWW.  Unfortunately, the local sports are more "important" part of the business.  You as a customer don't need that explained to you.  It should be common sense. Local sports are for locals.  Why must you idiots post this crap....just because you eat your food and drink your beer, doesnt mean they need to explain their reasons for not keeping your audio on...idiots!</div>

Chris as I stated to the first person who mentioned they are franchises:<BR/><I>Oh I realize they are a national chain with franchises. But since the national HQ didn't seem to care enough to respond I lump them all together at this point.</I><BR/><BR/>I also never expected BW3 food to be healthy. It just settles very badly with me even for poor quality food.</div>

BW3 has always provided decent to quality service in the Las Vegas area.  As previously stated, but obliviously overlooked, they are franchises and one should caution before pigeon-holing.  <BR/><BR/>Also, I don't remember the chain marketing themselves as a healthy option.  Just my observations though...</div>

I just left my local B-dub, the Highland's store in Louisville, KY, in a very unhappy state. My server was fabulous, but the lack of managerial response to my question and request was pitiful at best. <BR/><BR/>I am hapily consuming my beverages and food while watching my favorite college team play football on a pay-per-view channel. The the only reason I went there in the first place was that the game was on pay-per-view when it was actually being played and I could eat and drink with my friends while following my team. <BR/><BR/>During the 4th quarter, even though my team was ahead, the volume was suddenly changed to the "local" team game, which had started mid-way during my team's final period. I highly doubt that this would have happened were the situations reversed.<BR/><BR/>I asked my server to request that the manager change the sound back or explain why the audio was switched. He couldn't be bothered to do either. Is this how you manage a restaurant?<BR/><BR/>It would have been different had the manager been willing to engage in a direct dialog, but he was always "conveniently" on the phone and quite unable to deal with the situation (I should mention that all he did was lean against the bar and the wall; I never saw him leave that general area in the 3 plus hours that I was there). <BR/><BR/>I doubt that he had the necessary skills to deal with the situation as he was very willing to let the server deal with it instead of being a real manager and dealing with the problem head-on.<BR/><BR/>I can understand the "local" interest of an athletic program, but being a "local" with a different team loyalty within the same state doesn't mean that I should then be treated worse than a second-class citizen when it comes to the broadcast and volume of the game that I was enjoying prior to the start of that other game.<BR/><BR/>After much back-and-forth, none of which the manager would directly participate in, (I asked); I paid my tab, gave my server a big tip (over 30% as she was great, her place of employment sucks) and then left with no plans of ever returning there again. <BR/><BR/>I think the thing that bothers me most is the manager's obvious avoidance and unwillingness to do what he is paid to do: manage. All he did was manage to enrage a patron and leave a very bad taste in my mouth; not a good thing to do in any case. <BR/><BR/>I tried to find a way to contact the corporation to inform them of my experience, but nowhere on their website did I see a place to send feedback or comments, or to even contact them for any reason. If someone knows of an address to email them with my complaint, I would hightly appreciate the information.<BR/><BR/>Thank you for listening.</div>

We lived in Bloomington, IL for a while, and had similar experiences. Our friends liked the food so we ate there on several occaisions, but the service was always terrible. The food took ages to prepare, and on a few times when we had happy hours there the bar staff seemed annoyed that we wanted to open tabs and spend money there! In one case, one of my friends almost got in a fight with a bar tender over a beer that accidently got spilled. We now live overseas, so when we return to the U.S. I can think of many more places we miss eating at more than BW3! They won't get any more of my business...</div>

other Bill - it probably was just the management at that store.  However, the overall response still reflects poorly on the corporation to me. <BR/><BR/>However, the management has supposedly recently changed so perhaps I will give the place another try.  I always did enjoy the trivia game at least.</div>

Wow that is a really bad experience.  I've been going to BW3 in Houston since late 90s and I never had a bad experience.  You might want to try another chain!  But I understand you won't ever go there again since corp did not respond to you.  You might want to try sending them a letter snail mail, most places seem to respond via snail mail than email.</div>

B-dubs are franchises, so don't blame the whole chain.  Hopefuly the national office would take some interest & action in this franchise's shitty behavior.  Yeah, the food is grossly unheal;thy, but I love the stuff!</div>
