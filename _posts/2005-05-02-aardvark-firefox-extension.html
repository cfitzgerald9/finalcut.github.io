The other day I was over at del.icio.us and saw a bunch of new bookmarks to <a href="http://www.karmatics.com/aardvark/">Aardvark</a>, a firefox extension, but I ignored them. The today, at fullasagoog, I saw a link to digitalmediaminute that was also talking about Aardvark so I decided I could at least check it out.<br /><br />It's very very cool; at least from a web developers perspective. It gives you another nice tool for debugging CSS.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it yet, or even heard of it, consider this your invitation to go check it out. You will probably be glad you did.</div>
