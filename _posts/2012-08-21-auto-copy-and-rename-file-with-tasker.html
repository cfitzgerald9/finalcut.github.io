I play disc golf quite a bit and I use a great app, Easy Scorecard Pro, to keep my score each round. &nbsp;However, it has a glaring problem that the developer won't rectify - I can't share the generated scorecard directly to Google+ from within the app. &nbsp;I can share it to facebook but not G+ because, for whatever reason, G+ will only let you share images that are in your gallery and therefore the image is not attached to my G+ post from within the app. &nbsp;That kind of sucks.<br /><br />Today I came up with a workaround. &nbsp;It still is kind of clunky but it is a hell of a lot better than going through ES File Explorer and renaming the scorecard.png to something unique and then copying the image to my gallery. Then I had to switch to the G+ app and then I could post it to my disc golf circle.<br /><br />Instead I'm using Tasker to take care of the grunt work and now I just opent he G+ app and post to my circle. &nbsp;Here are the basic steps:<br /><br /><br /><ol><li>Create a new profile - I called mine "Scorecard"</li><li>Add an event to watch for. &nbsp;I'm watching for a file to be modified</li><ul><li>select the file at data/com.mydroidsoft.easyscorecard/scorecard.png</li></ul><li>Create a new task - I called mine "Copy to Gallery"</li><li>Pick action "Copy File"</li><ul><li>In the from field put data/com.mydroidsoft.easyscorecard/scorecard.png</li><li>In the to field put DCIM/Camera/scorecard%DATE%TIME.png</li></ul></ol><div>That's it. &nbsp;Just make sure your "Scorecard" profile is active and then, when you next go into Easy Scorecard Pro and create a scorecard image to share (I share to facebook) the scorecard.png will be modified at which point it will be copied to your gallery. &nbsp;Then, after posting it to facebook you can launch the G+ app and post the image from the listing - it will be the first image shown.<br /><br />At first I didn't realize I could add the name of the file into the "To" field so I was happy to see that it worked as I needed it to.</div></div>
