When storing information for an application some things obviously warrant encryption; for example passwords.  However, other elements may benefit from encryption that might not seem so obvious.<br /><br />For instance, do you encrypt users email addresses, real names, mailing addresses, or other tidbits?<br /><br />So, this post is more of a question than an observation - what and why do you encrypt and why don't you encrypt other tidbits of personal identifying information?</div>

Hi Bill,<BR/><BR/>You might consider picking up a book called Translucent Databases by Peter Wayner.  I've done some work with him and he's a pretty smart guy.<BR/><BR/>http://www.wayner.org/books/td/</div>
