Some smart guys have come up with a technique for resizing images while minimizing the artifacts.  This is either really cool or a great hoax.  I haven't read the PDF yet but the video is really amazing and seems pretty convincing.  <a href="http://www.seamcarving.com/">Check out the video</a>.<br /><br />Here is a <a href="http://www.zeropointnine.com/blog/seam-carving-in-as3-with-source">flash implementation</a> of it so I assume it is a valid technique.  If you have used it let me know if it has worked as well for you as the video implies.</div>

There is a flash demo at http://rsizr.com/ that is OK but doesn't respond well to large images.</div>

Thanks - it is pretty amazing really.    That bit on the beach where the guys just get zapped out of the image was incredible.</div>

Yes this is real and Adobe has since acquired the guy.  He gave a great live demonstration of seam carving/editing at Adobe Max 2007 in Chicago.<BR/><BR/>I'm sure this technology is bound to be implemented into Adobe technologies in the near future.</div>
