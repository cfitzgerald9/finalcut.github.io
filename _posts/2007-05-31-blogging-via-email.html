<div class='post'>
While I think I will rarely have a reason to post via this method to<br>this blog I figured I would enable the feature.  Now, whenever I&#39;m on<br>the go and I want to blog some cool new insight or technique (or<br>whatever) I can do so via email.<p>It should enable me to post more regularly - since my email app is<br>always open and I don&#39;t have to load a new page - but I can&#39;t really<br>promise anything because a lot of times I just forget to blog stuff I<br>think is interesting.  But, since blogger offers the feature, I<br>figured I might as well try to use it.<p>This post is my first effort at posting via Email.</div>
