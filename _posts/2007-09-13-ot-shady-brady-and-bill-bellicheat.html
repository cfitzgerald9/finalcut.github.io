Wow, my friend Ryan is on a tear right now and is cranking out new songs.  This new one is really funny and makes fun of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EU1O-hGxgg">Bill Bellichek and his cheating ways</a>.He explores the success the Patriots have had and wonders how much has been done via sneaky camera work.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><object width="425" height="353"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0EU1O-hGxgg"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0EU1O-hGxgg" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="353"></embed></object></div></div>

He has a bunch of songs - and some newer ones about the Patriots - and he wrote one about the Bills that you can see over at http://www.bandwagonbar.com/</div>

Love it!  Although I think maybe their Sony wasn't working before they were shut out by the Bills 31-0 a few years ago...  (it was working later that season when they returned the favor by the same score)</div>
