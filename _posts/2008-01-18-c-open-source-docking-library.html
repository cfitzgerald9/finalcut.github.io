I am working on a project that just begs for a dockable window interface and, fortunately, there is a pretty nice open source solution to that exact problem called "<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dockpanelsuite/">Dock Panel Suite</a>"<br /><br />It is really easy to get up and running and, in less than 4 hours, we had converted our entire MDI application into a dockable MDI application (ala Visual Studio).  It's really quite nice.  A nice bonus is that it is still actively maintained.<br /><br />The only real drawback is a dearth of documentation.  However, the sample app does help get you rolling.</div>
