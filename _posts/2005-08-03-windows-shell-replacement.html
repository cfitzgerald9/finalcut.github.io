Sorry for two totally non-CF related posts in one day but I figured I would share one other cool application - <a href="http://geoshell.org/content/view/3/9/">GeoShell</a>.  I have been using it for over 2 years now (giver or take a month) and it is pretty nice.<br /><br />One caveat though - you do need to muck with the registry to get things setup (unless the newer update I installed today comes with a better method).  I tend to update to more recent releases a little slowly as I have GeoShell installed on my work machine and I'm typically reluctant to do anything that might jeopardize it (like editing the registry).<br /><br />It takes up far less of my system resources than the explorer shell built into Windows uses, starts up faster, and is generally more usable (for me).  So, if you're feeling adventurous check out <a href="http://geoshell.org/content/view/3/9/">GeoShell</a>.</div>
