Surprise surprise - my friend Ryan Parker's song writing caught the eye of some folks at Playboy.com and they had him make a video, "<a href="http://videoarticles.playboy.com/?fr_story=68cf5735a9930ac4933dc939670f97d55ff30f44&rf=bm">Bristol's Mom Has Got It Goin On</a>" which is a bit of a political satire about Gov Palin.  <br /><br />Funny, I never really thought my tech blog would have a link to playboy on it.</div>
