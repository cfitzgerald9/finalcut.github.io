A quick reference to finding and downloading the latest and greatest stable version of Eclipse; CFEclipse, Colorer, and maintaining your plugins across multiple Eclipse installs (or upgrades).<br /><br />First you need to go to the <a href="http://eclipse.org/downloads/index.php">downloads page</a>.  However, once there, they hide the new milestone release from you. You need to click on the link "looking for the old <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php">Eclipse downloads page</a>?" True, you could just click on that link now, but that takes you out of the framed interface of the eclipse.org site - which may not be a good thing.<br /><br />Then just click on the link for the "xxx.x Stream stable build" - typically this will be the next upgrade level. For instance right now xxx.x = 3.1<br /><br />Now that you have Eclipse you should check out <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t18678.html">how to install your plug ins separately from Eclipse</a> (so you can have multiple copies of Eclipse installed using the same plugins), and of course you should check out <a href="http://www.spike.org.uk/blog/index.cfm">CFEclipse</a> (grab the latest nightly build) so that you can do all your CF development.  Finally, you may want to give <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34855">Colorer</a> a look (its a syntax highlighting plugin for Eclipse for stuff like javascript, xml, etc.; however it doesn't work with 3.1 M7 currently).<br /><br />I name</div>
