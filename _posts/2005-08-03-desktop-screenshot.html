Personally, I love the minimalism of it.  Plus, the right click menu on the desktop makes getting to things super easy; between that menu and GeoShell "HotKeys" I never have to dig to launch anything.<br clear="all" /></div>

thanks for the pointer darron.  I tried litestep out a few years ago but , for some reason, decided I didn't like it as much as geoshell.<BR/><BR/>Both are very capable.  The geoshell install process is a little easier.</div>

I've been using litestep for ages (http://www.litestep.net/).  There's an incredible amount of themes from minimal to, well, "maximal".  Plus, it has a large amount of modules you can use.  The most useful, to me, are the hoeykeys, virtual window manager, and command-line.</div>
