A few months ago I was turned onto a tool called the mach-ii beaner. It is a very handy tool for quickly creating CF based beans. However, it had a couple small failings. Nothing that has kept me from using it; but enough that they tickled the back of my mind until I addressed them.<br /><br />The mach-ii beaner is the result of the hard work of Jon Block initially and then added onto by Peter Farrell. I'm not sure how much extra Peter added because I have never seen Jon's initial copy. Needless to say I owe them both a big thanks for saving me TONS of time. However, as I said there were some small issues I needed to address with the copy I got from Peter in March of this year.<br /><br />Today I addressed those issues. I did nothing major, however they save me just a bit more redundant typing, and they remove a potential bug that could creep into your resultant bean.<br /><br /><ol>   <li>updated numeric types to have a default of 0 instead of ""</li>   <li>added support for a "date" type.  This is CF MX 6.1 support.  I will explain more in a second</li>   <li>added support to add a dump method</li> </ol> The CF MX6.1 date support is kind of tricky.  Bascially I fudge it.  There is no type="date" in CFMX 6.1 (that I know of).  However, there are a lot of times when I need a field to hold a date.  When that field receives a date I always want it to be formatted one way or another.<br /><br />So, what I did was let you type in date for your type while defining your bean template.  Then, when outputting the bean I replaced "date" with "string" when appropriate (such as type="string") but during the setter, if you defined a date format for me to use I added a little conditional.<br /><br /><cfif><br />    <cfset somedate =" dateFormat(arguments.someDate,"><br /></cfif><br /><br />Then the setter just does what it always does.<br /><br />Finally I added the dump method.  It takes in an optional abort parameter. If you call yourobject.dump(1) it will dump that objects variables.instance struct AND then cfabort.  Drop the 1 (or change it to a 0) and it won't abort.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I am allowed to distribute this file.  I haven't talked to Peter or Jon yet.  However,  if I can I will let you know and I will put it on the web for your downloading pleasure.<br /><br />For the time being you can always check out:<br /><ul>   <li><a href="http://www.jonathanblock.com">Jonathan Blocks Site</a> (origional author)</li>   <li><a href="http://blog.maestropublishing.com">Peter Farrell</a> (first modifiers site)</li> </ul></div>

Hi Guys,<BR/><BR/>This is great I'm very happy the Bean Creator is saving you all the painful process of rewriting. In my opinion, each developer has their "own little way" that they would want the bean creator to work for them. Personally, the way mine works exactly matches the way in which i interact with beans and CFC's. Modify and redistribute as you wish.... just don't forget about me when you become famous. ;=)<BR/><BR/>Cheers,<BR/>Jon</div>

On July 14th Peter Farrell released an updated version of it including my changes (for date and default numeric values, and maybe the dump method as well).  He probably added a bunch of other stuff too - I know it looks better!<BR/><BR/>You can check it out here:<BR/>http://rooibos.maestropublishing.com/</div>

I forgot to add that Jon came up with the idea and implemented it with basic getter/setter name and it's type.  I added all the extra checkbox options as well as the LTO support, allowing defaults, bean/LTO paths and the method that shows an example bean with a button.<BR/><BR/>Best,<BR/>.Peter</div>

Hi Bill,<BR/><BR/>Thanks for the blog entry.  If you send over the file, I'll happy merge them into the beaner.  The beaner needs a little work - especially the javascript.  Hopefully when I get a chance, everything will be fixed in the next update.  The new beaner will be called Rooibus ("roy-bus").  Thanks for the input - so far I like the ideas.</div>
