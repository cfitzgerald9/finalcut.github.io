Honestly, this seemed like it would be a straight forward process. &nbsp;Blackboard certainly hints at it being simple and straightforward. &nbsp;But it turns out disabling (and re-enabling) an enrollment isn't as obvious as you might hope.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">XML</span><br /><br />There is a bit of conflicting documentation but this is how we ended up getting it to work using Blackboard Learn 9.1 SP 8.<br /><br /><br /><ol><li>login to blackboard learn</li><li>go to the system admin tab</li><li>go to data integration</li><li>select student information system integrations</li><li>select your xml integration option (I'm not going into how to create one)</li><li>in the little arrow drop down pick "Edit"</li><li>make sure on the Enrollments row that "deletes" is set to "Disable"</li><li>go back to the Student information system integrations page</li><li>using the arrow drop down pick "Advanced Configuration"</li><li>use the arrow drop down on enrollment and pick "Field Mapping"</li><li>CHECK the "change or update?" box for "Row Status"</li><li>Tell it to use a "Custom Script" and paste in this script:<br /><pre class="javascript" name="code">var rs = true;<br />if ( data.rolesToAddOrUpdate.get(0).status = 0 ) {<br />rs = false;<br />}<br />rs;<br /></pre></li></ol><span style="color: red;"><b>WARNING</b></span>: &nbsp;If you don't setup blackboard as indicated then including recstatus=3 as an attribute on the ROLE node will cause the enrollment to be DELETED from blackboard. &nbsp;This will cause all artifacts created by that user within that class to be&nbsp;disassociated&nbsp;from them; thus if they are re-enrolled in the class they won't be tied to any of those artifacts. &nbsp;Many of the artifacts will still be there; they'll just be associated with Anonymous.<br /><div><br /></div><div>By disabling the enrollment the artifacts remain&nbsp;associated&nbsp;with the user so that when they are reenrolled in the class they don't have to re-upload all of their assignments etc.</div><div><br /></div><div>This process is useful for dealing with drops/holds on students as well so that their enrollment in the class isn't deleted (though it does disappear from the students interface) until their enrollment is reinstated.</div><div><br /><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: large;">Flat Files</span></div><div>If you are using the flat file (pipe delimited) process between banner and blackboard things are more straightforward. &nbsp;You just have to include the column "ROW_STATUS" with a value of "disabled" in order to disable an enrollment and "enabled" to enable the enrollment.</div><div><br /></div><div>A disabled enrollment using either of these methods will appear in to an administrator (and perhaps in some other scenarios) with a small red circle to the left of the enrollment record.<br /><br />You can learn about more of the process and the difficulties that were experienced in our transition from Vista to Learn over at <a href="http://www.jcummings.net/ims-enterprise-1-1-vista-xml-integration-blackboard-learn-9-and-processing-enrollment-changes/">John Cummings blog</a></div></div>
