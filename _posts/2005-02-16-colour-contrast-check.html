I just saw this link over at <a href="http://www.digitalmediaminute.com/">Digital Media Minute</a> that pionts to a Colour (or Color) Contrast testing tool for the web. It is pretty slick. You enter a foreground and background color and it will tell you if there is sufficient contrast in the colors for accessability. This is great when testing your site for usability by the visually impaired and those that are color blind.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html"><span style="font-size:100%;">Colour Contrast Check</span></a></div>
