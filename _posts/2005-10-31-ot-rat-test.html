I found this post today via another blog (Mac OSX Code i think) and while it doesn't relate directly to CF or development I thought it was interesting enough to share the link:<br /><br /><a href="http://productivity.strategy-blogs.com/2005/10/the_rat_experim.html">http://productivity.strategy-blogs.com/2005/10/the_rat_experim.html</a></div>

I don't remember the source, but I heard about an experiment where they did this with teachers.  They told them that half of the class was gifted and the other half was normal even though everyone in the class was the same.  The teachers consistently graded the "gifted" students better.<br /><br />Thanks for linking to that post of mine.  The new url for the site is http://www.productivity501.com, but the old links should transfer through for at least a few more months.</div>

Very interesting.  So if you have kids, you can make them do better in school by telling their teachers that they are gifted with a very high iq.... Couldn't hurt to try.y</div>
