Thanks to Squize at <a href="http://www.stimunationgames.de/blog/blog_comment.asp?blog_id=210">Tales From the Code Front</a> I was pointed to a tip on <a href="http://www.petebevin.com/archives/2005/03/10/firefox_popups.html">how to block popups that are snuck into firefox via flash</a>.<br /><br />Pretty handy.  If you need to let a specific site use this technique (for security purposes) Just add that site to your whitelist.<br /><br />To edit your whitelist I think you just need to:<br /><ol><br /><li>Goto Tools | Options</li><br /><li>Choose Web Features</li><br /><li>Click on the button "Allowed Sites" by block popups</li><br /><li>Enter the site url</li><br /><li>Click Allow</li><br /></ol></div>
