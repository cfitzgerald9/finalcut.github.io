With the release of mxna 2.0 I am finally getting away from the bill.coldfusionjournal.com site address and moving here.<br /><br />While both options are free I'm moving for a couple reasons:<br /><ol>   <li>Better Editor</li>   <li>A bit more control</li>   <li>I can change the way it looks</li>   <li>No advertising all over my blog.</li><li>Better feeds (includes a summary in my atom feed).<br />  </li>  </ol> So, if you used to visit me at http://bill.coldfusionjournal.com you will want to update your bookmarks to point here, http://cf-bill.blogspot.com instead.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>
