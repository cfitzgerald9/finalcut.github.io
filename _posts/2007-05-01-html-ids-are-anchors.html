It is said you learn something new everyday.  Sure enough, today is one of those days for me.  An id is the same thing as an anchor within a webpage.  "So what?" you might be saying.  The only way I can answer is to provide an example.<br /><br />Let's imagine you were creating a webpage and you wanted to provide someone with a link to a specific portion of that webpage.  Typically you might add an anchor tag &lt;a name="someanchor" /&gt; to the page and then use the url: http://somedomain.com/somepage.html#someanchor.  No problem right? Well, actually there is a little problem from a purely semantic perspective.  The anchor is probably latched onto nothing at all, or, as Tantek Celik puts it, you have an <a href="http://tantek.com/log/2002/11.html#L20021128t1352">Anorexic Anchor</a>.<br /><br />The anchor really should be wrapped around the content you are trying to anchor but you probably don't want to wrap an entire paragraph (or collection of paragraphs) in an anchor tag.  Instead you can just wrap the content in a div and give the div an ID value (remember, IDs are unique on the page).  So instead of our earlier anchor we would now have:<br /><pre class="xml" name="code"><br />&lt;div id="someanchor"&gt;<br /> &lt;p&gt;<br />  some content<br /> &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />The same url will still work even though there isn't an anchor there.  The ID serves as an anchor and your favorite browser will still navigate to the correct page and set the focus to the correct part of the page.  So ban those Anorexic Anchors and get in bed with Fat Anchors that actually do what they are supposed to!</div>

actually that number is the name of an anchor element inside the div.<BR/><BR/>You can use an anchor tag without specifying an href.  That is the only way I had known how to link to content in a page before I discoved this "id" technique.</div>

Apparently, the name attribute works as well. Try:<BR/><BR/><A HREF="http://cf-bill.blogspot.com/2007_05_01_archive.html#5429223066276640284" REL="nofollow"><BR/>http://cf-bill.blogspot.com/2007_05_01_archive.html#5429223066276640284<BR/></A><BR/><BR/>where that number is that value of the name attribute of the div containing this initial blog post.</div>

Interesting, even when you think you are a DOM wiz :) and it even works in IE6. A small note though, the URL should be absolute. E.G. http://lunarmedia.dev/#navigation doesnt work but http://lunarmedia.dev/default.aspx#navigation does :)</div>

I wonder how far this can be pushed?<BR/><BR/>eg: whether you can use the id of a form control as an anchor, so when the user clicks on it it not only goes to the correct page section but gives focus to a particular form control? saves messing around with JS if they're coming from outside the page</div>
