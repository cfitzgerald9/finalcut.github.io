I had to write a little ruby script the other day - it was really trivial - to parse a tab delimited file.<br /><br />I haven't had much opportunity to use Ruby before (though I have played with it a little bit) so I was happy for an excuse to try it out.  I won't post the code (it's kind of clunky) but even so I can say, Ruby is fast at parsing these kinds of files.<br /><br />My file was about 2800 rows and 14 columns and almost as soon as I hit enter on "ruby myrubyscript.rb" at the command prompt it was done parsing the file and writing the new file (which created a bunch of SQL insert statements for an upgrade script).<br /><br />It was far faster than I expected; blindingly fast.  It was refreshing to say the least.  I use CF (not necessarily the right tool for the job all the time) to accomplish small tasks like this a lot (because CF is so easy) but Ruby was just as easy and it was definitely faster to complete this type of task.<br /><br />One problem I had initially was that Ruby can't generate Guid's natively (or if it can I couldn't find a reference about it).  However, <a href="http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2005/10/27/8991.aspx">Brad Wilson posted a solution</a> that worked great.  It's pretty cool how easy it was to integrate the win32 api calls into Ruby.</div>

Anyone who develops in Cold Fusion deserves a good kick in the balls.</div>

Simeon,<br />I can see how you would feel that way.  However, I personally don't have that much of an attachment to any one language primarily because I have to switch so often at work.<br /><br />For example I am currently working on a C# project, a VB.net project, a CF project, and I'm using Ruby to make some tasks easier.</div>

Ok, this will sound stupid, but I have to ask.  Do you ever feel like a traitor when working with ruby?<br /><br />I think its important to always expand your skills so I have been learning ruby and rails.  I like ruby because it offers me a new scripting lanugage, as well as a free web language.  It also acts as another backend for my flex work.<br /><br />But everytime I start to build something with it I feel guilty, like i am betraying my CF roots.  It sounds so silly but I thought I would see if you also felt some of that.  I know cf is not the right tool for every job, but i still feel weird. :)</div>
