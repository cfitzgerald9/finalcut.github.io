Some of the people who find my blog ask about Ryan and his songs. He tried to stop singing and writing songs about six months ago but the lure of sports songs was too strong for him and he is back. He has put all of his videos back up on youtube and has even put up a couple new ones already. So if you have been wanting to hear ryan's songs go over to his website at <a href="http://ryanparkersongs.com">RyanParkerSongs.com</a> and give them a listen.<br /><br />Here is his newest video, Blame it on a Bengal, which makes fun of all the criminal trouble the Cincinnati Bengals have had<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qlLRfgEFXPs"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qlLRfgEFXPs" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></div>
