<blockquote>My friend Ryan, a prolific Sports Song writer also has a more sensitive side and records a bunch of acoustic songs that deal with more personal issues than sports.  He just signed up today on a site called <a href="http://thesixtyone.com/ryanparker">thesixtyone.com</a>.  The site is pretty cool and lets you discover all sorts of new music.  It's kind of like a digg for unsigned bands.<br /><br />Anyway Ryan has put up 3 songs there so far (it is all he can put up while he is an unknown there) but, as his songs get voted on and he moves up in levels he can add more music.<br /><br />So, now you can hear Ryan's non sports stuff at <a href="http://thesixtyone.com/ryanparker">his page on thesixtyone</a> or his sports songs on his blog at <a href="http://ryanparkersongs.com">Ryan Parker Sports</a></blockquote></div>
