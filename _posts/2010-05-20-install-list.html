<div class='post'>
My work laptop has been having some problems lately so I am moving to a temporary machine until a new one is in the budget.  As I do this I wanted to record what software I need to have installed on my machine in order to get my daily work done:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/">Coldfusion Server</a> - I installed 9 but none of my customers use it.  Most are using 7 and a couple are using 8.  I already ran into a couple incompatibilities, especially with my session facade becuase it used an undocumented feature of getPageContext().  Now I use getPageContext["session"] instead of getPageContext().getBuildinScopes()["session"] - I'll blog about that a little more later.<br /></li><li><a href="http://editplus.com/">Editplus</a> - this is still my absolutely favorite text editor though I really dislike the tree control in the file explorer.  It is buggy even if the developer doesn't agree.</li><li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTE0MzQzMTk">Dropbox </a>- this auto installs for me both KeyPass AND Executor which are awesome utilities.  I don't know how I survive without DropBox - it rocks.</li><li>Oracle 10 client - I may need the Oracle 9 client too - but I hope not.</li><li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp">Java 5 SDK </a>- The install yesterday was a bit different than what I remembered but it worked.</li><li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">Ant 1.7</a> - I also need a bunch of extra libraries like ant-contrib, mxunit-ant, svnant, and a couple others.</li><li><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache 2</a> - I run Apache 2.0.55 so I installed the exact same version on the temp machine just because I knew I could port my conf file more easily.</li><li><a href="http://www.coldspringframework.org/">Coldspring </a>- some of my coldfusion apps need it.</li><li><a href="http://model-glue.com/">ModelGlue </a>- some of my coldfusion apps need it.</li><li><a href="http://www.mxunit.org/">mxunit </a>- I can't do coldfusion development without my trusty unit test framework.  This thing just works and it works well.</li><li><a href="http://www.allroundautomations.com/plsqldev.html">PL/SQL Developer</a> - Oracle could learn so much from these guys on how to create a useful too.</li><li><a href="http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel">Chrome </a>- I like chrome and it is my browser of choice - though I use the dev channel build which often gives me odd problems.  The built-in bookmark sync is pretty awesome too.<br /></li><li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/personal.html">Firefox </a>and <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug </a>- You can't really do any serious web front end development without firebug IMHO.</li><li><a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird </a>- My favorite email application is even better with paired with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/">lightning </a>and the google calendar connector.</li><li><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/">Malware Bytes</a> - I like to have this already installed on any computer; just in case.</li><li><a href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/">MediaMonkey </a>- ok, so I don't NEED this to be installed but I sure do love it. <br /></li><li>MS SQL Server - I am holding off on installing this but I'll need to have it before too long.</li><li><a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner">CCleaner</a> - an nifty utility for maintaining my computer.  Just beware of the annoying toolbars and other things it tries to install with it.</li><li><a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a> - great and free FTP client</li><li><a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> - great and free zip compression utility</li><li><a href="http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> - great and free IM client</li><li><a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a></li><li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a></li><li><a href="http://www.2brightsparks.com/downloads.html">SyncBack</a> - Awesome, awesome, awesome free tool for synchronizing two directory trees. <br /></li><li><a href="http://www.expandrive.com/windows">ExpanDrive</a> - a nifty cloud-based harddrive service.  A long time ago I signed up for a deal with <a href="http://www.joyent.com/">TextDrive</a> (now Joyent) which gave me a lifetime account to a few things; one was strongspace.  <a href="http://www.strongspace.com">Strongspace</a>, last year was sold to ExpanDrive, so my lifetime account moved to them.  It's sort of like Dropbox but isn't as seamless to get going and I have 50Gb of space instead of the 3Gb I get with Dropbox.</li></ul>Those are the minimum things I really need to put on the computer.  Here are the follow up things I'll need for less active projects or that I will probably end up wanting:<br /><ul><li>MS Excel</li><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=3657ce88-7cfa-457a-9aec-f4f827f20cac&amp;displaylang=en">MS Word Viewer</a></li><li>MS Visual Studio 2005</li><li>MS Visual Studio 2008</li><li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a></li><li><a href="http://php.net/">PHP </a><br /></li><li><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby (1.8)</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> (<a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a>)<br /></li><li><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gomlab.com/eng/">Gom Media Player</a></li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> (so MediaMonkey can talk to my iPhone)</li><li><a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> - my favorite photo management software.  Not because it is amazingly feature rich (I actually liked adobe's better) but because it is free and works pretty well.</li><li><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm">IsoRecorder</a></li><li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/iphonebrowser/">iPhoneBrowser</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cogniview.com/pdf2xl-enterprise.php">PDF2XL Enterprise Edition</a> - this tool is pretty freaking amazing at converting PDF files to Excel files.  It's a little over $100 for their best version and it is worth every penny.  On the downside their licensing/activation process is onerous.<br /></li><li><a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/secursw/ps2308/">Cisco Systems VPN Client</a></li><li>...</li></ul>Undoubtedly I'm forgetting a few programs.  When I encounter those I'll try to come back here and update the list.</div>
