This is a pretty simple tip that might save some of you some time/trouble. &nbsp;I actually started doing this originally on firefox so I assume it is still relevant there.<br /><br />In firefox I used to create bookmarks and associate a keyword with the bookmark. &nbsp;For instance if you wanted you could create a bookmark for slashdot.org and then add the keyword '\.' without the quotes. &nbsp;Thus, when you typed \. in the address bar the bookmark would be loaded and you'd go to slashdot.org.<br /><br />Chrome bookmarks don't support keywords - but custom search engines do. &nbsp;Thus when I moved to chrome a couple years ago all of my keyword shortcuts were moved into custom searches. &nbsp;For instance, for one of my projects to get to it's specific issue tracking system I have a custom search defined as warpbugs. &nbsp;When I type warpbugs in the chrome address bar and hit enter the url I provided for the custom search engine (the actual web address of the issue instance for warp) is loaded. &nbsp;It works exactly like the keywords for bookmarks that I used in chrome. <br /><br />Here is the slashdot example but as a custom search in chrome:<br /><br /><ol><li>right click in the address bar</li><li>choose "edit search engines" from the popup menu</li><li>scroll to the bottom of the "other search engines" pane</li><li>In the "Add new search engine" box type "slashdot" without quotes</li><li>in the keyword box enter "\." without quotes</li><li>in the url with %s in place of query string just put in http://www.slashdot.org</li><li>hit the OK button.</li></ol><div>Now go to your address bar, type \. and hit enter. &nbsp; Voila.</div></div>

I took a look at my custom search engines.  It looks like they might be integrated with google bookmarks. </div>
