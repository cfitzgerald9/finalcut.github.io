<div class='post'>
For a few months now I've noticed that the option to reboot into recovery has been missing from my cyanogenmod rom'd android phone. &nbsp;I'm running the latest nightlies and not being able to quickly reboot into recovery is the epitome of a first world problem. &nbsp;Be that as it may I still wanted the feature back so I finally spent a few minutes googling for the solution.<br /><br /><br /><ol><li>enable developer options. &nbsp;These used to be in the normal settings screen for the phone but they are hidden now.</li><ol><li>go to about phone</li><li>scroll to the bottom</li><li>find the "build number" field</li><li>click on it seven times and it will turn on developer options.</li></ol><li>go back one level to the main settings screen and you'll see developer options now. &nbsp;Open that</li><li>Enable advanced reboot options by clicking on the relevant checkbox</li><li>go back to the main settings menu again and then click on "System" under the interface section</li><li>Inside the system menu click on "Power Menu"</li><li>Make sure "reboot menu" is checked.</li></ol><div>That's it. &nbsp;It's relatively simple but because the settings are very hidden it can be next to impossible to find them. &nbsp; Please note that the reboot options won't appear if your phone isn't unlocked.</div></div>
