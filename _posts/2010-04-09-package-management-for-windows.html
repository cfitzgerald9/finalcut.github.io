All I can say is - it's about time!  According to this article by ArsTechnica Microsoft Developer <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/04/microsoft-offers-much-needed-fix-for-windows-oss-development.ars">Gerrett Serack is embarking on the bold plan to produce an open source package management solution for Windows</a>.  Meaning windows users will have something akin to APT.  Very very cool.  Even better it is a community driven project and not a Microsoft Driven one so hopefully the end result will be something we all want and will use.<br /><br />Like I said, It's about time.</div>
