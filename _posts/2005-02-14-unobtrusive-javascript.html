As a huge proponent of unobtrusive javascript I figure I am pretty much obligated to reference this site; <a href="http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/">http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/</a> - since everyone else is. It is a nice, brief tutorial on what unobtrusive javascript is all about and provides some simple examples of its use. So, if you don't know what all the fuss is about, go check it out. Also, don't miss my example of <a href="http://rawlinson.us/blog/index.php?p=147">unobtrusive sortable tables</a>.</div>
