So my buddy Ryan, the singer/songwriter, was actually on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9raSm3ODHMY">Monday Night Football singing a song about the Bengals</a> with his daughter Julia.  He just put the video up on YouTube.   His daughter is great in it.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><object width="425" height="353"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9raSm3ODHMY"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9raSm3ODHMY" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="353"></embed></object></div></div>
