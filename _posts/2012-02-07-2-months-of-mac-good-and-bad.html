<div class='post'>
I started using a mac two months ago after over twenty years of windows use. &nbsp; However, rather than reiterate my opinion on both of my blogs (personal and technical) I've posted the full story over on my personal blog and I'm just putting a link to it here:<br /><br /><a href="http://blog.rawlinson.us/two-months-with-a-mac-the-good-and-the-bad">http://blog.rawlinson.us/two-months-with-a-mac-the-good-and-the-bad</a><br /><br />I don't like cross linking like this but I hope you'll understand that this is a topic that might be interesting to both my technical friends/followers and my non-technical friends/family. &nbsp;I hope you'll click through and read it and, maybe even comment with some helpful tips and tricks.<br /><br /><br /></div>
