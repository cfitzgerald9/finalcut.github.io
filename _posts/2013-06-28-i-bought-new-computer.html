It has been a very long time since I bought myself a computer. &nbsp;I think close to ten years maybe. &nbsp;I have a great computer via my job so for the most part I've not needed a personal machine. &nbsp;Historically, my great work computers have also been laptops so I really haven't needed a computer at home. &nbsp;But I decided I needed one now. &nbsp;My work computer is a beast of a desktop workstation and I have some personal projects I really want to build and I can't build them at them at the office.<br /><br />Thus, I broke down and bought a computer. &nbsp;I really debated a lot about what computer to buy and I'm sure I'll hear from a few people giving me shit for the choice I made. &nbsp;But I think I'll be happy with it.<br /><br />I bought a Mac Book Pro. &nbsp; I've never bought a Mac before. &nbsp;I had some real issues I had to work through in my mind before I'd buy it. &nbsp;But, in the end, I decided it was the best path for me even though it is more expensive, by a lot, than the other laptops I considered.<br /><br />I gave a lot of thought to a variety of smaller ultra books (including the Mac Air) but I ended up ruling them out. &nbsp;I also seriously considered buying a computer that was custom built for linux (Ubuntu seems to be the only flavor I could find a custom build for). &nbsp;But, I have a long long history of bad luck with Linux and I'm really not in the mood to fight for Linux anymore. &nbsp;I also really don't like the user experience of Windows 8.<br /><br />I could have gone with a Windows 7 machine but I didn't like the feeling of buying a computer that won't be supported going forward unless I follow down the windows 8 path. &nbsp;I really don't like windows 8.<br /><br />So I bought the Mac Book Pro, 15" with "Retina" display. &nbsp;It just arrived yesterday and I haven't had nearly enough time to play with it yet. &nbsp;However, I can say that I really really like the display. &nbsp;My monitors at the office are pretty good - they have 1920x1080 resolution. &nbsp;But there is a definite difference in the crispness of text on the MacBook. &nbsp;I don't know if that is because of the 2880x1800 resolution of the screen or the difference in the glossy coating or what. &nbsp;But it's definitely not a placebo effect.<br /><br />I don't really notice the SSD performance change. &nbsp;I had heard that it would be a huge shift for me and that I'd never want to go back to a regular hard drive. &nbsp;So far I haven't really noticed anything spectacular but I also haven't done much with it. &nbsp;I'll be curious to see if I ever really notice the change.<br /><br />I did pay for the upgrade of RAM to 16GB. &nbsp;I was able to use my Marshall student discount so that that additional chunk wasn't too painful over the crazy high base price of the computer. <br /><br />The biggest thing I've noticed about the computer is how freaking light it is. &nbsp;I know I could get other laptops that are lighter (though I'm not sure I could find a lighter 15" laptop). &nbsp;At just over 4 pounds and less than 3/4" thick it's really pretty remarkable to just hold.<br /><br />I think if I hadn't used a Mac Pro when working at Marshall I probably wouldn't have considered the Mac Book Pro this time around. &nbsp;I was pretty skeptical of OS X and my ability to bounce between it and windows. &nbsp;But it really wasn't that bad. &nbsp; I've covered must of my issues with OS X elsewhere and, fortunately, I've found workarounds like Moom and Witch that help me get past some of those issues. &nbsp;Plus I'll be spending the vast majority of my time either in the terminal or in Sublime Text 2 so the changes won't really bother me at all.<br /><br />So now I just need to start building those projects I've had my eye on. &nbsp;When I get a couple of those knocked out then I won't be put off by the price of the computer anymore because I'll have finally gotten my ass into gear and gotten some things done.<br /><br />If I don't.. well, you can line up to kick me for being a dumb ass.</div>
