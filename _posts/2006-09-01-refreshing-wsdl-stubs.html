This is actually something I got from <a href="http://www.bpurcell.org/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=965">an old blog post by Brian Purcell</a>  but I figured I should have it handy in case his blog ever disappears and I need to reference it again.<br /><br />Basically it is just a programatic method for refreshing WSDL Stubs in CF that I stick at the top of every test file I have that access a remote method call on a CFC..<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br />&lt;cfset serviceURL = "http://127.0.0.1/lb2/remote.cfc?wsdl" /&gt;<br /><br />&lt;cfobject type="JAVA"<br />          action="Create"<br />          name="factory"<br />          class="coldfusion.server.ServiceFactory" /&gt;<br />   <br />&lt;cfset RpcService = factory.XmlRpcService&gt;<br /> <br />&lt;cfset RpcService.refreshWebService(serviceURL)&gt;<br /><br /><br />&lt;cfinvoke <br />  webservice="#serviceURL#"<br />  method="someMethodName"<br />  returnvariable="someVariableName" /&gt;<br /><br /></pre></div>
