This seems like it should be obvious but it turns out getting PEAR isn't straight forward. &nbsp;The documentation at pear.php.net is inaccurate for a windows install where you use the installer at php.iis.net to install PHP on IIS7. It turns out there is no go-pear.bat file in your php directory after installing this way. &nbsp;However, after some trial and error and a bit of luck I figured out this seven steps to getting PEAR installed.<br /><br /><ol><li>Download go-pear.phar at&nbsp;<a href="http://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar">http://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar</a></li><li>put that file in your php home directory.</li><li>open a command window as administrator; move to your php home directory</li><li>enter "php go-pear.phar" without quotes</li><li>accept the default value for everything it asks about; system wide, path options, updating your php.ini etc</li><li>once the script is done pear is installed; you just have one last step</li><li>in windows explorer go to your php home directory and double click on PEAR_ENV.reg to update your registry</li></ol><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
