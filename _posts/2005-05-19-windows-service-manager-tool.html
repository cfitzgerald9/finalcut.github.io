If you have to start/stop services at all during a typically development day then <a href="http://www.shlomygantz.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=C7D6FEE1-40CA-7F8D-8E76EF91F5737896">this free tool</a> will probably be a great help to you.<br /><br />It lets you create simple profiles that start or stop various services. So if your running CF 6 and CF 7 on the same box you can jump between the two profiles very easilly. Check it out!<br /><br />In the future they are talking about letting you potentially queue the order of the start/stop requests which would be really handy!</div>

Hey!<br /><br />I found a similar service manager:<br />http://winservicemanager.codeplex.com/<br /><br />It is free and you can request custom functions that the developer implements for you.</div>
