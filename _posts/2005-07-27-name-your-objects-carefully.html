I spoke about this briefly earlier this month on the CF-DEV mailing list but thought I should put a reminder here for posterity sake.  Sometimes the most obvious name for a CFC is not the best.<br /><br />For example, I was modelling an application that dealt with student enrollments in classes.  I had defined a student object, a class object, a studentenrollment object, an address object and some others.<br /><br />The studentenrollment object consisted of the student info, the class info, and a bunch of other information regarding the students performance in the class.<br /><br />All of this was working fine until I went to instantiate the class object and do something with it.  I can't remember what it was I tried to do but CFMX threw an error saying that CLASS was a reserved word in ColdFusion.  Now, it is kind of obvious once you see it - especially when you consider that CFMX is just a Java wrapper - but I was kind of shocked at first since CLASS isn't defined as a CF reserved word.<br /><br />Because the CF documentation never mentions CLASS being a reserved word you need to be careful to consider not just <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=ColdFusion_Documentation&file=part_cfm.htm">CF reserved words</a> but also <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html">Java reserved words</a>.  I ended up using an alternative name for my object but had to spend some time refactoring due to the rename.<br /><br />So save yourself the trouble in the future and carefully choose your object names bearing in mind words that may be applicable but are reserved by more than just CF.<br /><br />Here are some links that might be useful to you:<br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=ColdFusion_Documentation&file=part_cfm.htm">CF Reserved Words</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html">Java Reserved Words</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/tsqlref/ts_ra-rz_9oj7.asp">MS SQL Reserved Words</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/doc/oracle/server803/A54656_01/vol2_wor.htm">Oracle 8 Reserved Words</a></li><br /></ul></div>
