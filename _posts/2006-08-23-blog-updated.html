I just moved over to the new "blogger beta" and in so doing I also changed the sites template.<br /><br />Nothing too exciting but overall I'm glad to be on the "cutting edge" here in blogger.com world.  So far I like the changes on the back-end; maybe I'll be inspired to post more frequently now?</div>

the site used to look a bit different (green and white) and the back end stuff (what I use to post to the blog) has been updated to be a bit faster.<br /><br />overall there isn't a whole lot different in this iteration of blogger (or this blog).<br /><br />This post was mainly designed to let the few regular readers I have know they were still at the right place even though the pages look drastically different (green and fixed width to blue and fluid).</div>
