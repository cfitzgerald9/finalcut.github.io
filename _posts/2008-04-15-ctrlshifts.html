Hey, some I'm a little (ok a LOT) slow.  But I accidentally discovered the keyboard shortcut of "CTRL+SHIFT+S" inside Firefox with the web developer toolbar installed.<br /><br />Quick, before you look - what do you think it does?  If you guessed view the current pages style sheets in a new tab then you're a winner!  Sorry, no prizes though.<br /><br />I have probably used that feature of the toolbar hundreds of times in the past - but I never really noticed the keyboard shortcut.  <br /><br />I love looking at the CSS for any page that looks really good.  I almost always learn something (even if it is that I am not as good at CSS as I'd like to be) and, now, thanks to a fat fingered "Copy" I am able to see the pages style faster than ever before.</div>

I didn't know that one either.  Though, honestly, I rarely want to open a recently closed tab.  I've probably needed to do so 2 or 3 times since Firefox gave me the ability.<BR/><BR/>This isn't becuase I am good about closing tabs only after due diliberation - but rather becuase I never close any tabs so I end up with tons of tabs open at once.<BR/><BR/>I'm more likely to close the browser by accident than a specific tab :O)<BR/><BR/>Thanks for sharing though.</div>

You know the shortcut CTRL-SHIFT-T for firefox? A real life saver, it reopens the last closed tab :)<BR/><BR/>"Use it wisely young jedi" <BR/><BR/>Cheers, Sidney</div>
