It turns out the F5 key doesn't do a page refresh on a mac.  That is a habit I just don't think I'll be able to break.  Fortunately, macs have a built in way to define application specific keyboard mappings.  Here are the instructions for mapping the F5 key to refresh in Chrome.<br /><blockquote><ol><li>Launch "System Preferences"</li><li>Click the "Keyboard" icon</li><li>Select "Keyboard Shortcuts" tab</li><li>Hit the little "+" button under the main white area</li><li>In the little pup-up window select "Google Chrome" as the Application</li><li>Type in "Reload This Page" in the "Menu Title" field exactly as it appears in the Chrome's View menu (no quotes of course)</li><li>Click inside the "Keyboard Shortcut" field and hit F5 key (or any desired combination)</li><li>Restart Chrome to make it work</li></ol></blockquote><span style="font-family: arial, 'san serif'; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: arial, 'san serif'; font-size: 13px;">If you use safari this same process will work for that application as well</span><br /><span style="font-family: arial, 'san serif'; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: arial, 'san serif'; font-size: 13px;">Thanks to "paulcik" and his comment on the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=73c83d887892a0a2&amp;hl=en">google support forums</a>.</span></div>

I may get used to that but I like just hitting one key.<br /><br />I have a lot of adjusting going on just  getting used to the overall experience, so making page refresh familiar is a small indulgence for me.<br /><br />Thanks for the correct shortcut though, I&#39;ll see if I can start adopting it.<br /><br />Bill</div>

Command+r does a page reload by default in all browsers I&#39;ve used on OS X.</div>
