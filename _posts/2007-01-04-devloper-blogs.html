There are a ton of blogs about software development out there. Some are just repositories of trivial tips (much like this blog) but some are great and should be read by a wide audience.  One blog I put in this category is <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Raganwald</a> - a blog by a pretty insightful guy in Vancouver (I think).  I've been reading his blog for about a year now and he consistently produces thought provoking entries.  If you are a software developer (it doesn't matter what tools you use) you should at least take a look at his blog - you will probably find a few entries that get you thinking in new ways.<br /><br />If you don't, because everything he says to you is old hat, and you have a blog, let me know about it so I can learn from both of you.</div>

Thanks, I'm very flattered. My first glance at "In the Trenches" makes me want to sit down and read the entire blog, post by post. Nice!<br /><br />p.s. I'm actually in Toronto at the moment.</div>
