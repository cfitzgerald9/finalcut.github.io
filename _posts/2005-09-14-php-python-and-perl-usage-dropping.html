I was just reading my most recent edition of <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com">Software Development Times</a> (SDTimes) and came across an interesting graphic.  I only post this because it immediately reminded me of <a href="http://www.web-relevant.com/blogs/cfobjective/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=2F7C602C-BDB9-5320-EB50C1461F58460F">Jared Rypka-Hauer's rant against PHP</a>.<br /><br />It seems that PHP, Perl, and Python have experienced a pretty severe drop in usage in Eurpoe, the Middle East, and Africa over the past year.  Each with over a 20% decline in usage (statistics provided by <a href="http://www.evansdata.com">Evans Data Corp</a>)!<br /><br />The key quote from the article seems to be:<br /><blockquote><cite>John Andrews, COO Evans Data</cite>"One of the key factors for this loss of developer mindshare has been the inability of these languages to penetrate the enterprise space"</blockquote><br /><br />I wonder what their survey result said about non-open scripting languages such as Coldfusion? <br /><br />Notes:<br /><ul><br /><li>Even though CF is tag based I still consider it the equivilant of a scripting language</li><br /><li>Additional Data is avaiable via Evans Data Corp on what appears as a for-sale only basis so I have no insight into the CF usage patterns</li><br /></ul></div>

Pete - like Treach', I think a lot are switching to RoR. That or Java/.NET, which IMO are more "stable" than PHP positions.</div>

I think the more interesting question is what are PHP, Python, and Perl users switching to?</div>

I have stopped using PHP as well.  I think people are seeing there are better ways to do things out there.  PHP is the quick and easy fix.  It is a remarkable tool for developing web applications but I have since moved on to my new infactuation <A HREF="http://www.rubyonrails.com" REL="nofollow">ruby on rails</A> which may be the most productive web framework and most interesting language I have developed in to date.</div>
