I noticed I've really not been doing a good job of posting to my blog and I want to recitify that.  In order to do so I decided to simplify
by getting rid of octopress and swtiching to plan old Jekyll.

Octopress is built on Jekyll but I often forgot what I was doing with Octopress and I had trouble keeping it working on my windows and mac machines so
I figured it was a good time to simplify.

I am using a theme called "[Notepad](https://github.com/hmfaysal/Notepad/)" written by Hossain Mohd. Faysal. which I've tweaked a little bit for my
tastes.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with it at the moment.

I plan on posting more often now that I've simplified.  Hopefully I can actually follow-through on that plan.
