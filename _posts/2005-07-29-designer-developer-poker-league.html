Josh Dura, the man who brought us the Designer Developer Poker Tournament, has done it again.  This time he is building a poker league for all of the designers and developers out there.  To get things going he has created a pretty nice site at <a href="http://www.stylebluff.com">stylebluff.com</a>.  If you like to play poker, or just think you might like to play, you should swing over and join the fledgling community of friendly poker players.  I hope to see you across the digital felt!</div>
