Recently I've been running a lot and when running I use Endomondo to track my time/distance details. &nbsp;However, it's kind of a pain to grab my phone, unlock it, and then hit the pause/stop button at the end of an exhausting run. &nbsp;I seem to just end up adding 15 seconds to my overall time as I fidget with my phone.<br /><br />Yeah, I know, first world problem.<br /><br />I also play a lot of disc golf. &nbsp;I use Easy Score Card pro to track our scores on each hole. &nbsp;The course we mostly play is 19 holes long so I am unlocking the phone 19 times during the round while walking on less than smooth terrain. &nbsp;It's a bit of a pain.<br /><br />Yep, another first world problem.<br /><br />Anyway, I decided to make my life easier by creating a simple Tasker Profile that will turn off my screen lock when either of those two applications are running. &nbsp;I call it "Screen Lock Off" and here is how I created it.<br /><br />NOTE: you have to have the secure settings helper installed to get this to work.<br /><br /><br /><ol><li>In Tasker, first thing to do is create a "Task" callled "Turn off Lockscreen"</li><li>Add action -&gt; Select "PLUGIN"</li><li>Select "Secure Settings"</li><li>A fairly unhelpful screen appears. &nbsp;Click "Edit" in the configuration box.</li><li>Scroll down to Password/Pin and select it</li><li>Select "Enter Password once before unlocking"</li><li>Make sure the "Enabled/Disabled" button says "Disabled"</li><li>Touch the "diskette" icon to save the configuration</li><li>You're now back at the unhelpful screen but it should also say "Clear Password/Wait for Unlock"</li><li>Touch the "back arrow" to go back to the tasks screen.</li></ol><div>Now we need to create a second task to turn the lock screen back on.</div><div><ol><li>Repeat steps 1-6 from before but name this one "Turn on Lockscreen"</li><li>Make sure the "Enabled/Disabled" button says "Enabled"</li><li>Pick either Pin or Password</li><li>Enter the Pin/Password you want your lockscreen to use</li><li>Confirm your Pin/Password</li><li>Repeat steps 8-10 above.</li></ol><div>Now that both tasks are created to go the Profiles tab and we'll create the profile.</div></div><div><ol><li>Click the "+" to create a new profile</li><li>Pick "Application"</li><li>select any applications you want to fire off the "Turn off Lockscreen" task</li><li>After you've selected some apps, click the back arrow in the top left of the screen</li><li>When prompted pick the "Turn off Lockscreen" task</li><li>The profile now exists</li><li>Long press on the profile to put it in edit mode.</li><li>Long press on the "Turn off lockscreen" task under the profile</li><li>Select "Add Exit Task"</li><li>Select the "Turn on Lockscreen" task</li></ol><div>That's it - you're done. &nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>NOTE: Each time you update your ROM you'll have to reinstall the secure settings helper plugin .. You can do that easily from within the secure settings app that remains installed.</div></div>
