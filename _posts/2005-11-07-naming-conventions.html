<div class='post'>
On a recent post on the cfc-dev list Chris Scott stated:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />variable names start lowercase with each word starting upper: userName<br /><br />class names (cfc names) start uppercase: SecurityService.cfc or User.cfc<br /><br />instances of classes are variables, so they follow the variable naming convention: user is an instance of User.cfc <br /><br />methods in cfcs, start lowercase: user.getName()<br /><br />I'm not sure where the community stands on this, but cf cfunctions (reserved keywords) should start uppercase: ArrayAppend()<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I post this to support the conventions he mentions as "standard CF conventions" and I hope others practice them as well (I know alot do, but for those that don't, please consider them).</div>
