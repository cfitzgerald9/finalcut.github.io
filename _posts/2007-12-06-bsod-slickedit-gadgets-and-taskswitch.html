I have been doing a lot of .Net development these past few months and one thing about visual studio that drives me crazy is keeping track of what line the focus is on when I  jump to a search result.  The cursor is not intrusive at all which is great when you're  typing but it sucks when you are trying to jump to a line of code.<br /><br />I found the solution to that a few days ago thanks to SlickEdit Gadgets for Visual Studio 2005.  They have this "ruler" tool that highlights the current line in the color of your choice.  I was so happy!  Well, until today <a href="http://community.slickedit.com/index.php?topic=768.msg3364">when I was alt-tabbing</a> between two instances of Visual Studio and BAM I got a Blue Screen of Death (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=BSOD&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">BSOD</a>).<br /><br />It turns out that the <a href="http://community.slickedit.com/index.php?topic=659.0">gadget does some trickery</a> to generate the highlight because, quite frankly, there doesn't seem to be many other ways to do it.  The trickery deals with double buffering and some calls to the PrintWindow API call.  That works great so long as you aren't using a special ALT-TAB replacement for windows that shows you a thumbnail of the screen you're alt-tabbing to.  As it turns out I was using a wonderful free tool called <a href="http://www.ntwind.com/software/taskswitchxp.html">TaskSwitch XP</a> which makes the same PrintWindow API call at the same general time as the gadget did.  Windows doesn't like this double call to PrintWindow and so you get the dreaded BSOD.  Crap.<br /><br />I personally don't really need the little thumbnail.  What I liked about the TaskSwitch XP was that I could be alt-tabbing with my left hand and using my mouse with my right hand and clicking on an entry in the task list to switch to it; plus TaskSwitch XP gives a better textual description of what you are switching too.  What's a spoiled alt-tabber to do when he needs to better be able to see where he is contextually in his code?<br /><br />I didn't want to drop TaskSwitch XP but I did because I found a replacement that is perfect for me.  It does everything TaskSwitch XP did but without the thumbnails and, just like TaskSwitch XP it is free.  I am now using <a href="http://www.smarttab.org/">SmartTab</a>.</div>
