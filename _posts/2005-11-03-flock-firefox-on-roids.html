<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I am testing out a new piece of software today called "Flock". It is firefox with a bunch of built in features that are very smootly integrated. Some of the features are very cool.<br/><br/>First off it doesn't do favorites the way you are used to. Instead it has a seamless integration with del.icio.us - so whenever you post a favorite it just goes there - and isn't stored locally at all. I kind of like this and kind of don't. In the past I have been pretty sparing with what I store in del.icio.us. I have primarilly been selective because I make all of my del.icio.us bookmarks public so I only give the inherent endorsement of the link when I really think it is worthwhile. On the otherhand I have bookmarked things locally that I just plan on reading again a bit later. Perhaps I will just use a tag to differentiate the two.<br/><br/>Flock also has a pretty smooth process of integrating RSS/ATOM feeds. I haven't really used it yet but overall it looks promising.<br/><br/>I am currently using another handy feature, which I may come to find irreplacable, and that is the built in blog editor. I already registered both of my blogs with it and can post to either at will. Plus, for this blog, I can have the blog editor auto-ping MXNA - something I couldn't do with blogger before. Pretty handy.<br/><br/>I am not sure Flock will replace Firefox quite yet (it already hung on me once and had to be killed) but it does look like a compelling improvement on FireFox based on my current web usage.<br/><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/web-browser" rel="tag">web-browser</a></p></div></div>
