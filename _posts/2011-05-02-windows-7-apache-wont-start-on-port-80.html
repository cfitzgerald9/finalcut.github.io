Today I ran into a strange problem where Apache wouldn't start.  I kept getting an error saying it couldn't bind to the socket (I only saw the error detail if I tried to start Apache from the command line).  I then ran the following command:<br /><br />netstat -o -n -a | findstr 0.0:80<br /><br />And saw that something unidentified was listening on Port 80 - netstat couldn't figure out what but it knew it was assigned Process ID (PID) 4.  I then went to task manager, turned on the PID column, and saw that the NT Kernel was PID 4.  WTF?  Why would the OS be listening on Port 80?<br /><br />Well, it turns out the OS was just sort of acting as a proxy - and I wasn't getting the full story.  Thankfully, a little Googling turned up an<a href="http://www.honk.com.au/index.php/2010/10/20/windows-7-pid-4-listening-port-80-apache-cannot-star/"> article that identified the culprit</a> for me.. SQL Server Reporting Services (I installed SQL Server 2008 last week).<br /><br />I went into the Service manager, killed that service, and bam! Apache started right up.<br /><br /><br />Crazy.</div>

Wow... thank you so much. That&#39;s exactly what it was for me too after stopping at least 20 different services.</div>

I found that windows 7 was running &quot;world wide web publishing service&quot; it was listning on port 80.<br />After I stopped it I was able to run Apachie.<br /><br />World Wide Publishing Service is used for IIS.</div>

Hi.<br /><br />In my case was the service <br />&quot;Web Deployment Agent Service&quot; <br />that was blocking the port.</div>
