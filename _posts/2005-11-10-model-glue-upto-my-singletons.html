Ok, so the title of this one stretches the theme of depth in my exploration of Model Glue but it does highlight an important feature of Model Glue - the Singleton.<br /><br />A few days ago I talked about caching my security object kind of like this:<br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br />   &lt;cfif NOT ExistsInCache("security")&gt;<br />  &lt;cfset AddToCache("security",createObject("component","lb2.util.Security").init()) /&gt;<br />   &lt;/cfif&gt;<br /><br />   &lt;cfreturn GetFromCache("security") /&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />Well, today as I was digging into the Model-Glue website I came across a post that mentioned a method named "createSingleton()" which, oddly enough, doesn't exist anywhere in Model Glue.  Fear Not though Joe has this covered in much the same way I often create Singletons when not using Model Glue.<br /><br />Within your controller you can call getModelGlue.getSingleton(param1,param2) and it handles the creation if necessary - otherwise it returns the previously crafted Singleton.<br /><br />param1 is the type of object you want to create.  So, in my case I am almost always creating a "component" singleton.  Basically param1 is the same thing you pass into createobject in CF as the first parameter.<br /><br />Likewise param2 is the "component" to be created, again just like with createobject (hint GetSingleton calls, you guessed it, CreateObject if your singleton doesn't exist).<br /><br />So now my method getSecurity looks like this<br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br />  &lt;cfreturn getModelGlue().getSingleton("component","lb2.util.Security") /&gt;<br /></pre></div>
