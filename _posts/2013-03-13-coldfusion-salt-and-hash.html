This isn't particularly ground breaking or even noteworthy - I mean people have been salting and hashing passwords for quite a while - but I figured I would put this coldfusion component out there to help people who haven't done salting and hashing in coldfusion before.<br /><br />If you aren't really comfortable with the terms salting and hashing or<a href="http://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm"> salted hash - then please read this great article on the topic</a>.<br /><br />I'm not really going to go into any detail on the component here - instead I'll just point you to <a href="https://github.com/finalcut/SaltAndHash#readme">the github repository where you can read the readme and checkout the source code</a>.<br /><br />Please provide feedback if you see something incredibly stupid in the code - or better yet submit a pull request.<br /><br /><br /></div>

Regarding use of Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator with CF, GenerateSecretKey() is as good as java.security.SecureRandom right?  http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/CFMLRef/WSc3ff6d0ea77859461172e0811cbec22c24-6e72.html</div>
