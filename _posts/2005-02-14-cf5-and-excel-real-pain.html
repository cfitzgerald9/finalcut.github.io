Well I have been struggling with CF5 and MS Excel interoperability now for a few days and I have to say, "I'm annoyed!"<br /><br />I have tried to invoke a COM component to read the Excel file since the customer does have Excel installed on their server:<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br /> &lt;!--- Create an Excel component ---&gt;<br /> &lt;cfobject action="Create" type="COM" class="Excel.Application" name="objExcel"&gt;</pre><br /><br />but something as simple as:<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br /> &lt;!--- Load the file into the component and save ast a comma seperated list ---&gt;                <br /> &lt;cfset displayalerts=" 0"&gt;</cfset></pre><br /><br />fails with the error:<br /><div class="preholder"><pre>        <br /> Unable to set the DisplayAlerts property of the Application class</pre></div><br /><br />Doesn't matter if I'm using Excel 2000, 2003, or XP. So I thought, I'll give the option suggested by a commenter - create a DSN and query the uploaded Excel file.<br /><br />So, I setup a DSN using CF Admin and the Merant Excel drivers but then I get a different error:<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br /> ODBC Error Code = S1000 (General error) <br /> [Microsoft][ODBC Excel Driver]General error Not enough information to connect to this DSN with SQLConnect. <br /> Use SQLDriverConnect. <br /> SQL = "SELECT * FROM [CF$] IN 'C:\WINNT\TEMP\ACF3C3.tmp' 'Excel 8.0;'" Data Source = "EXCEL_DSN"</pre><br /><br />So, I thought, well I'll try and use the MS Excel Driver (.xls) and see what happens. So I headed to the ODBC Administrator of Windows and setup a System DSN<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br /> Error Diagnostic Information<br /> ODBC Error Code = S1C00 (Driver not capable)<br /> [MERANT][ODBC Excel driver]Optional feature not implemented.<br /> SQL = "SELECT * FROM [CF$] IN 'C:\WINNT\TEMP\ACF3C4.tmp' 'Excel 8.0;'"<br /> Data Source = "EXCELDSN"</pre><br /><br />First off, I know the DSN names between the two are different - that's intentional. Secondly I have also tried both with the queries in these two formats:<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="sql"><br /> SELECT *<br /> FROM [CF$]<br /> IN '#attributes.inputFile#' 'Excel 8.0;'<br /> AND<br /> SELECT *<br /> FROM "Excel 8.0; DATABASE=#attributes.inputFile#; HDR=YES".[1]<br /></pre><br /><br />The first format I found on the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?event=view&id=KC.tn_18656&amp;amp;amp;extid=tn_18656&dialogID=3070366&amp;iterationID=2&sessionID=4830a5c3a1b4$3F$3F$3&amp;stateID=1%200%2019642060&amp;mode=simple">Macromedia site</a> the second format I aquired from <a href="http://www.rewindlife.com/">Samuel Neff</a> in an example he had on his site.  Both generate the same errors for the corresponding Excel driver.<br /><br />So, now I'm going to try the <a href="http://www.emerle.net/programming/display.cfm/t/cfx_excel2query">cfx_excel2query</a> tag I posted about before. The problem is I have to now have the excel file modified before I can use it because the header row is actually the second row. If I could have used the COM option then the end user wouldn't have to change the spreadsheet. Who knows, maybe the custom tag won't work either!<br /><br />If you have any ideas on why this isn't working - please feel free to share your thoughts with me.  I'm going crazy!</div>

No sorry, the only solution I found was to upgrade to CFMX 6 (or 6.1) and it worked fine then.<BR/><BR/>I fear it just won't work with CF5.</div>
