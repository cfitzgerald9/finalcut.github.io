I just read about the newest part of the Google Maps API - Elevation.  I immediately stole their demo application and put the <a href="http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2010/03/aint-no-mountain-high-enough.html">Google Maps Elevation API</a> to <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/huntingtonwvfiber/why-huntington/our-maps?pli=1">practical use</a> alongside a stop motion animation video I made using Google Street View.  You can see both <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/huntingtonwvfiber/why-huntington/our-maps?pli=1">over here</a>.<br /><br />You have to scroll down on the page but the video is a tour through my hometown made using Google Street View and Picasa.  The map under it shows the elevation changes as you travel the same route.   The best thing I could do (but don't at the moment) would be to figure out a way to synchronize the two so that as the movie played the little placemark in the map moved.<br /><br />For the time being you can hover over the bar chart at the bottom and you'll see a green placemark move around the map as you move over the chart.</div>
