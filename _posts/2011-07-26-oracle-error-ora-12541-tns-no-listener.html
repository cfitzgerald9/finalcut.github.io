I was on vacation last week and when I returned, I could no longer connect to my local Oracle instance.  My C# apps and PL/SQL developer both reported a ORA-12541 TNS: no listener error.<br /><br />I hadn't changed anything before I left and I certainly hadn't changed anything as soon as I got back so I was a little perplexed.  Fortunately, there was a pretty easy solution which I extracted from <a href="http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/ORA-12541">The Oracle FAQ</a>.<br /><br /><ol><li>Check your listeners status by going to the command line and entering the Listener Control Program using command LSNRCTL.  Once in the program enter the command: STATUS<br /><br /><br />The tool suggests you also start and stop the listener but that had no effect for me.  My listener just didn't want to work.<br /></li><li>Recreate your listener.  Again, go to a command prompt but this time open up the Network Configuration Assistant using the command: netca</li><li>Inside this tool you first need to delete your listener.  Mine was actually called "listener" and I just accepted all of the defaults when deleting it.  Once it is deleted, recreate it, again I used all of the defaults.</li><li>After it was created I went back to the Listener Control Program (LSNRCTL) and ran the STATUS commaned.  This time it looked pretty good and, sure enough, my apps and PL/SQL Developer were able to connect to the database.</li></ol></div>
