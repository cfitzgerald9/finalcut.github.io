<div class='post'>
I recently (in October) moved an old very shabby project I wrote into GitHub.  I did this for two reasons.  The first is I've been keen to try out Git for a while and this seemed like a good opportunity.  The second is that a few people have asked for this source code in the distant past so I figured I might as well just stick it out there.<br /><br />Now, I'm not going to lie - <a href="http://github.com/finalcut/ColdBreadCrumbs">the code I put up there</a> is pretty crappy.  However, this post isn't about that - it's about a strange problem I've had with Git the two times I have tried to use it.<br /><br />Back in October when I setup everything I had to create an ssh key.  I'm not even sure where the first one ended up going so I decided to just use the "default" settings and trying again.  I had associated both public keys I created that day with my github account and I was able to add the files and push them up.  I figured all was good and the next time I made a change things would be smooth.<br /><br />As Lee Corso says, "Not so fast my friend!"<br /><br />Today I updated the readme file and wanted to push the file up.  At first I forgot I had to start a command prompt with the git_cmd.bat file but once I realized that I kept being told "Permission Denied (publickey)"  <br /><br />I looked in the docs and they all suggested the key should be in my /documents and settings/<username>/.ssh directory - none were but some of those I had previously created were in my root git directory so I copied them out to my ~/.ssh directory.  Then I tried again and got the same error message.<br /><br />At this point I though, well, I'll try the git_bash.bat file.  Same problem.  So I ended up creating a new keypair using all the defaults again and then associating this new public key with my github account.  At this point I was able to push my changes up.  <br /><br />Am I doing something wrong that leaves me needing to create a new key?  Did I not have to create a new key this time and I just had something setup wrong?  I don't know.  I seriously hope I don't have to create yet another key the next time I try this out.</div>
