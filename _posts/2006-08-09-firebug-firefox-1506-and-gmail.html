Just a few posts ago I was raving about how great Firebug is.  Sadly, I have had to disable the extension already.  Firefox, at times, can be slow on its own but it is still my preferred browser (though Opera 9 is very nice).  However, with firebug activated my tendency to leave Gmail running in an open tab at all times just brings Firefox to a near standstill and, quite frankly, as much as I like firebug I like Gmail even more (I just love that conversation view).  <br /><br />So, for the time being I'm off the firebug bandwagon.  <br /><br />Damn.</div>

Hi Bill. I came across this entry when searching for anyone experiencing the same problem with FireBug and Gmail, but sadly, your post was as close as I came to finding a solution... So I gave in and <a href="http://www.paulchaplin.com/blog/firebug-and-gmail-friends-at-last/">hacked one together myself</a> - full do-it-yourself instructions are included, for the rightfully-wary of my hacked XPI.<br /><br />Hopefully, Joe Hewitt will include a customisable domain filtering mechnanism in a future version (it's already a feature request), but until then, this might help.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Paul</div>

Gmail is better than what? It is my preferred email system.  But if you comparing it to firebug - it's apples to oranges.  Firebug is a debugging plugin for firefox; it is great for evaluating javascript problems in webpages.</div>

I think gmail is better.  Have switched to it since it came into the market.</div>

I Love Firebug! Especially lately because I have been doing a ton of AJAX development and it is so handy to see the passing of the calls and returns. But I can see that gmail might be a problem.</div>
