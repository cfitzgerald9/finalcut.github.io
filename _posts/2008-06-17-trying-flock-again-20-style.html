After way, way, way too much time I figured out that Flock wasn't the cause of my high CPU usage spikes of DPC's it was from other people copying things off of my external hard drive.&nbsp; So, with a positive outlook and hopes for good things I have installed Flock 2.0b which is based off of Firefox 3 (which goes live today as well).<br /><br />Sadly, right off the bat I hit a snag.&nbsp; As soon as I installed Flock, and tried to launch it, it crashed.&nbsp; I think this may have been because I already had Firefox 3 RC 3 running but I'm not sure.&nbsp; I am currently running it in safe mode (flock.exe -safe-mode from the command line) and it seems to be working fine.<br /><br />In fact I've added a few new accounts to different sites to have in my "people" bar and am blogging this from the built in Flock blog editor.&nbsp; I've noticed some sluggishness while typing (text not showing up right away) but beyond that and a bunch of false positives in the spell checking (seems and this?) which I think is just a screen drawing issue (also reflecting the sluggishness) it seems pretty good.<br /><br />As I use the editor I am actually finding a couple of other small problems.&nbsp; The first is that you can't pick which blog your publishing too until you hit publish.&nbsp; From a usability standpoint I think this is a problem as I wasn't sure what would happen when I clicked on publish.&nbsp; Now that I know I hit cancel to amend this post and the editor tells me the blog post was saved (when it wasn't).&nbsp; This false positive notification is probably just a beta bug that will be fixed by the time it is finalized.</div>

Well I'm still having problems getting Flock 2.0 to like me.  I disabled all of the addons I had (2) and it still crashes nearly instantly if I start it in non Safe mode.<BR/><BR/>Basically, it starts with the flock start page but then when I try to go to a different website it crashes.<BR/><BR/>It doesn't matter what URL I try to go to either. .Kaput - I don't think flock 2.0 is ready for me.</div>
