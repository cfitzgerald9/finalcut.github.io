Anyone who even casually reads my blog knows I talk about software development and occassionaly interject a little bit of sports.  This is a bit of the later.  I found <a href="http://thebandwagonfan.blogspot.com">this blog</a> by a sports fan who is painfully honest.  He is the epitome of a fairweather fan - and he claims the title proudly.  His posts are laced with delusions, hope, and quick dismisal of his teams that lose.  It is a new blog but should be a fun, occassional distraction.  Check out <a href="http://thebandwagonfan.blogspot.com">The Bandwagon Fan</a>.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see who his new "favorite" football team is.<br /><br />Links:<br /><a href="http://thebandwagonfan.blogspot.com">The Bandwagon Fan</a></div>
