<div class='post'>
A few months ago I updated Tortoise SVN which, subsequently, broke <strike>Subeclipse</strike><ins>Subclipse</ins> (the Ecplise SVN plugin) due to a change in the way SVN in general worked with the Tortoise update.  No biggie I figured I could just use Tortoise SVN alone until <strike>Subeclipse</strike><ins>Subclipse</ins> was updated.  Lo and behold I found out today (thanks to <a href="http://nil.checksite.co.uk/index.cfm/2007/2/8/Subclipse-update">someone else's blog</a>) that <strike>Subeclipse</strike><ins>Subclipse</ins> had an update available.<br /><br />It fixed the problem.  Hooray!<br /><br />If you are using <strike>Subeclipse</strike><ins>Subclipse</ins> but don't have the update site in Eclipse you can <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/#subclipse">get it here</a>.  They have information on updating regardless of what version of Eclipse you are using.</div>

I do not know if you looked for the update before and did not find it, but if you did it might have been because the project is named Subclipse, not Subeclipse.</div>
