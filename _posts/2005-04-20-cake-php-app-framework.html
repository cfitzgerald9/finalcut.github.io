I was just looking at <a href="http://sputnik.pl/cake/">CAKE</a> - a pretty slick looking PHP application framework that I was directed to by <a href="http://www.digitalmediaminute.com/">digitalmediaminute</a>. Overall it looks very slick and easy to use. My only caveat is that it appears you need a full copy of the framework for each application on the server. I guess that is OK in some regards - you can have some apps using different versions of the framework (which may or may not be a good thing). However, I like the idea implemented in mach-ii that lets you invoke the framework from within your application while only having a single instance of the app on your server.<br /><br />Truth be told I don't know if you can do that with<a href="http://php.mach-ii.com/"> mach-ii for PHP</a> but you can for CF.  Another truth though is while I have read all about <a href="http://www.mach-ii.com/">mach-ii</a>, played with it, and had a great desire to use it, I haven't been able to. All of my current projects are on CF 5! And I haven't had spare time to do anything fun with either CF MX or 7.<br /><br />I am also trying to learn <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby </a>but have had quite a bit of trouble just getting<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/"> ruby to work on my windows box</a> with apache. So if anyone has any tips on that I'm open to suggestions/advice/help. I really want to dig into the inspiration behind cake - <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> which looks VERY COOL.<br /><br />Then maybe I can start development on <a href="http://rawlinson.us/blog/?p=179">lootly!</a></div>
