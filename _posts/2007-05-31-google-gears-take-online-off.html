Google has released a new beta product called "Google Gears" which looks to be a really slick JavaScript API that will allow you to take dynamic website applications and give them an off line instance.  This way users can work in a disconnected state and then, when back online, resynchronize their data.<br /><br />Gears contains three components:<br /><dl><br /><dt>LocalServer</dt><dd>Cache and serve application resources (HTML, JavaScript, images, etc.) locally</dd><br /><dt>Database</dt><dd>Store data locally in a fully-searchable relational database</dd><br /><dt>WorkerPool</dt><dd>Make your web applications more responsive by performing resource-intensive operations asynchronously</dd><br /></dl><br /><br />The offline version is updated automatically everytime a user reconnects so long as the online versions "manifest.json" file has it's version number properly incremented.  <br /><br />Overall it looks really slick and I can't wait to dig into it a bit.  You can check it out at <a href="http://gears.google.com">http://gears.google.com</a></div>
