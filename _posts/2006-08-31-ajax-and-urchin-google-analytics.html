It turns out you can use Urchin to track Ajax usage (who knew?) - here is a handy page in the Google Analytics Help Center that <a href="http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=33985&topic=7292">tells you how</a>.</div>

This is similar to the way you'd track events (or "pages") on a flash site: http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=27243&ctx=sibling . We're using Analytics to track hits and views to our flash site (http://www.pierinc.com) in that manner.</div>
