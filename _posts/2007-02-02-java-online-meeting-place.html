<div class='post'>
In 1999, for my Senior Project at University, I built a java shared workspace/chat/whiteboard/videochat type thing.  It isn't the greatest collection of code ever but some of it isn't too bad.  If nothing else I learned a lot working on it.<br /><br />The project is now indexed in <a href="http://www.koders.com/info.aspx?c=ProjectInfo&pid=NU4RZUPHL7LTN7QVZ5QF7YRE7A">Koders</a> (and has been on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharedspace/">sourceforge</a> for a long time) so if you are looking for some ideas or want to much around with the code you can now check it out in detail.</div>
