While I won't be there (I have not been to one yet) I figured some of you might be interested in knowing about the <a href="http://cfunited.com/topics.cfm">CFUNITED <strike>schedule</strike> topics</a> that was recently published.  It isn't quite complete as a few sessions are still TBD - but overall there looks to be some interesting topics.<br /><br />There are two in particular that I would like to be able to see; David Ross's presentation on Coldspring and Sean Corfields on Factories (he also plans to touch on Coldspring, Arf, and Reactor).<br /><br />This is actually the first year I have seen discussion on topics that I would want to go and see.  But 2 sessions is far from enough to warrent me, or my employer, spending the money to send me.  However, to those of you going (July 4th, 2006 weekend) - I hope you enjoy it!</div>
