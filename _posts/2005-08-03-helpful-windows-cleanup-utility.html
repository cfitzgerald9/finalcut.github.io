Based on a link over at "<a href="http://576871.blogspot.com/">injun's blog</a>" (as seen on mxna) I decided to download <acronym title="computer crap">CC</acronym>cleaner and give it a whirl.  When all was said and done it found about 770MB of temp files it could safely delete from my system.  Plus it found a bunch of no longer valid registry settings.  To top it off it found all of this and cleaned up the mess in under five minutes.<br /><br />I have tried using the windows disk cleaner utility before but, let's be honest, it sucks.  It brings my whole system to a halt and takes forever to get anything done; and that's just during the analyisis phase - you can forget about using your computer when it is actually cleaning.  CCcleaner doesn't have that problem.  I continued to work while CCcleaner did it's job.  I highly recommend (for windows users only).<br /><br />You can <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/">download it at cccleaner.com</a></div>
