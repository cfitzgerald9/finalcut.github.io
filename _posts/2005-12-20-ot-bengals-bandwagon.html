I know this has nothing to do with CF or development in general - but I wanted to share a funny song.<br /><br />My friend, <a href="http://ryanparkersongs.com/">Ryan Parker, is a pretty good singer/songwriter</a> who is also a huge Bengals fan.  He has been a fan of the Bengals for pretty much his entire life and has followed them through all the crappy years upto this point where he has a moment of glory.  However, he is distrubed that he is forced to share the moment with so many fair-weather fans who suddenly love his team.  In honor of the wannabe's he recorded a new song - <a href="http://ryanparkersongs.com/">Bengal Bandwagon</a>.  It's a great track and well worth a listen even if you aren't a Bengals fan because you can laugh at the bad years the Bengals had as well as appreciate what they have accomplished recently.</div>

I doubt if you will see that I replied to your comment.  However, if you do.. <BR/><BR/>I don't have any picks or prognostications to share from earlier in the season.  In fact I put very few non-tech posts on this blog.<BR/><BR/>However, next year I will (if I remember too) I will put them up on my more personal blog (rawlinson.us/blog) so that my guesses will be as open to review as yours were this year.</div>

responded to your comment.  <BR/><BR/>do you have a "prognosticator" that didn't have both hits and misses in their predictions at week 2 in the season?  no one has a job for actually predicting the future.</div>
