<div class='post'>
This is a UDF I wrote a while ago (that probably alredy existed on the net in many forms) that I need to use on occassion.  For instance I had to write a tool that would import a static HTML website into our CMS.  However, the client only wanted certain parts of the page imported as content, they wanted the page names to reflect the old "title" etc.  So this UDF made it easy to get the chunks of each page that I wanted.<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="coldfusion"><br />&lt;cffunction name="getTagContent" returnType="string" output="false" hint="returns all contents between an open and closing tag"&gt;<br />&lt;cfargument Name="tag" type="string" required="true"&gt;<br />&lt;cfargument Name="str" type="string" required="true"&gt;<br /><br /> &lt;cfscript&gt;<br /> var matchStruct = structNew();<br /> var startTag = "&lt;#tag#[^&gt;]*&gt;";<br /> var endTag = "&lt;/#tag#&gt;";<br /> return REReplaceNoCase(str, "(.*)(#startTag#)(.*)(#endTag#)(.*)", "\3");<br /> &lt;/cfscript&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/cffunction&gt;<br /></pre></div>
